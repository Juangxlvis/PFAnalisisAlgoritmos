  abstract={Analyzing human-machine collaboration behavior is crucial for integrating generative artificial intelligence(GAI) into the work of pre-service teachers, thereby enhancing teaching efficiency and quality. This study focuses on 55 pre-service teachers, employing lag sequential analysis and content analysis to examine their recorded collaboration processes and reflective texts. The aim is to explore the behavior patterns and characteristics of human-machine collaboration based on GAI. The findings indicate that the sequence C2→C1/C5→C3/C4→ C2 represents an efficient human-machine collaboration behavior pattern, in which pre-service teachers ask GAI questions, refine its responses based on their understanding, and iteratively collaborate to optimize lesson plans. The advantages of GAI in this collaboration include efficiency, comprehensive knowledge, clear logic, and lack of temporal and spatial constraints. However, its disadvantages are poor comprehension, limited professionalism, lack of personalization and innovation, reduced sense of communication, and technological limitations. The results provide significant insights for optimizing educational practices through collaboration between pre-service teachers and GAI.},

  abstract={Integrating generative artificial intelligence tools can allow one to manage and develop novel business methods efficiently. With the introduction of self-learning generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools, the corporate world is trying to figure out the applications and their business implications. Major technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc., have shown enormous interest in investing in ventures developing generative AI tools/models. These tools/models can be experimented with, and their business use is being explored. The study aims to explore the potential uses of generative AI (GAI) in academics through its current capabilities and applications. The study also highlights the potential challenges and concerns arising from using generative AI in academics. The study has used descriptive and quantitative methods to answer the research questions. The study has used a questionnaire based on the Likert scale to measure the significance of indirect variables, viz. perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived trust (PT) on direct variable adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AGAI) in academics. The sample size consists of 100 students and 100 university professors. The study Mentions that perceived ease of use (PEOU) positively influences GAI (AGAI) adoption. Also, perceived trust (PT) has a predictive ability of AGIA when controlling for PEOU. The use of generative AI in a few years will become imperative in most human lives, which makes it mandatory to explore the possible ways of its adoption in the mainstream rather than avoiding or restricting its usage in academics.},

  abstract={The recent rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the resulting market growth, has introduced new challenges for social responsibility, an area where companies may need more guidance. In this regard, the literature covers a broad spectrum, from the impact of bias to the potential use of this technology to implement undemocratic surveillance. Another focus area discusses the AI industry's commitment to human rights and social responsibility, examining the diverse actors involved in this commitment and the context-dependent nature of their impact on human rights. This work performs a systematic review and a comparative analysis of the strategies and actions taken by four leading companies—OpenAI, Meta AI Research, Google AI, and Microsoft AI—with respect to five critical dimensions: bias, privacy, cybersecurity, hate speech, and misinformation. Our study analyzes 192 publicly available documents and reveals that depending on the diversity of products and their nature, some companies excel in the research and development of technologies and methodologies for privacy preservation and bias reduction, offering user-friendly tools for managing personal data, establishing expert groups to research the social impact of their technologies, and possessing significant expertise in tackling hate speech and misinformation. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for greater linguistic, cultural, and geographic diversity in research lines, tools, and collaborative efforts. From this analysis, we draw a set of actionable best practices aimed at supporting the responsible development of AI models, and foundation models, in particular, that are aligned with human rights principles.},

  abstract={A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},

  abstract={Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.},

However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students' perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students' learning capacity.},

  abstract={With the convergence of modern computing technology and social sciences, both theoretical research and practical applications of social computing have been extended to new domains. In particular, social computing was significantly influenced by the recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the conventional technologies of AI have various drawbacks in dealing with complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows some advantages over the conventional AI. This article firstly reviews the latest research progresses of AI in social computing. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges AI faces in social computing, which motivate the necessity to introduce H-AI to tackle social-oriented problems. Finally, we discuss the concept of H-AI and propose a holistic architecture of H-AI in social computing, which consists of three layers: object layer, intelligent processing layer, and application layer. The proposed architecture shows that H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.},

  abstract={Based on the problems of insufficient design innovation and low design efficiency in personalized visual communication design, this study uses the style transfer algorithm to apply a specific artistic style to the design and automatically generates visual elements with personalized characteristics. At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs. This paper also uses a style transfer algorithm to combine user-favorite elements with design templates to generate preliminary design sketches. Then GAN intervenes to generate new design elements and uses these elements to enrich and refine the design content. During the design process, the artificial intelligence model is continuously optimized based on user feedback to ensure that the final output design not only meets the user's personalized needs but is also highly innovative and attractive. Ultimately, these individually adjusted designs are output in an appropriate format for application in actual products or services. Based on comparative experiments, this paper found that personalized design is superior to traditional design methods in multiple key indicators: the average innovation score of personalized design is as high as 9.06, higher than the 6.89 of traditional design; the time required for personalized design is mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 minutes, while the time required for traditional design ranges from 30 to nearly 50 minutes and fluctuates greatly; the adoption rate of personalized design reaches a minimum of 90.2% and a maximum of 99.9%, while the adoption rate of traditional design is lower, with a minimum of only 75.2% and a maximum of only 88.7%. Through comparative analysis, this paper confirms the advantages of personalized design over traditional design in multiple dimensions, and demonstrates the application potential and value of artificial intelligence technology in the field of design.},

  pages={5266-5274},
  abstract={As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

  abstract={Research on utilization of artificial intelligence in higher education has significantly expanded in recent years. However, the existing literature in this domain highlights a shortage of research in specific subareas, such as ChatGPT and the innovative utilization of advanced artificial intelligence tools. With the growing number of studies focusing on artificial intelligence in higher education, there is a need to assess to what extent the current body of research is filling the previously reported research gap. This study aims to review research published within the last 11 months in the year 2023, to assess the status and direction of recent publications in these specific areas and to provide a comprehensive summary that will assist scholars and higher education institutions in shaping their future work on artificial intelligence in higher education. Using a systematic literature review methodology, 295 articles published on the Scopus database were analyzed. The review findings indicate that the majority of papers serve a general overview purpose, with a moderate focus on generative AI, advanced integration of AI into teaching and learning, and prediction modes. On the contrary, a limited number of papers were directed toward AI for assessment, AI Chatbot, and support for administrative processes. These findings highlight the need for a shift of research efforts from more general exploration topics to a more advanced investigation into the usage of AI tools in a novel and sophisticated manner.},

  abstract={Traditionally, ideating new product innovations is primarily the responsibility of marketers, engineers, and designers. However, a rapidly growing interest lies in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to brainstorm new product and service ideas. This study conducts a comparative analysis of ideas generated by human professionals and an AI system. The results of a blind expert evaluation show that AI-generated ideas score significantly higher in novelty and customer benefit, while their feasibility scores are similar to those of human ideas. Overall, AI-generated ideas comprise the majority of the top-performing ideas, while human-generated ideas scored lower than expected. The executive's emotional and cognitive reactions were measured during the evaluation to check for potential biases and showed no differences between the idea groups. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, companies can benefit from integrating generative AI into their traditional idea-generation processes.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years and has significantly impacted various domains, including cultural heritage. Indeed, AI technologies offer unprecedented capacities to analyze huge amounts of historical data, enabling researchers and art historians to uncover precious patterns, connections, and insights that might otherwise remain elusive. Also, the efficiency and accuracy of AI techniques play a pivotal role in many cultural heritage-related tasks, such as cataloging and organizing extensive cultural collections, streamlining the management of heritage resources for present and future generations. However, the integration of AI in cultural heritage also brings forth intricate ethical questions. These span over the issues of authenticity, subjectivity, and interpretation biases of an AI-empowered, reproduced, and/or generated artwork up to the legal concerns related to authorship. However, such issues are mostly undefined and unaddressed in the scholarship at the intersection on AI, ethics, and cultural heritage. This paper aims to pave the way to fill such a gap of context-sensitive ethical issues for AI in cultural heritage. To this aim, the paper first analyzes the main opportunities and benefits raised by AI in cultural heritage. Then, matching benchmark, agreed-upon AI ethics principles elaborated in the AI ethics scholarship in the last decade and relevant to cultural heritage, it highlights specific ethical risks that ought to be considered for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI in and for cultural heritage. Finally, areas requiring further attention and work, and actors call to intervene, are identified to facilitate next steps for ethics and governance of AI in cultural heritage.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about a significant revolution in image processing. This revolutionary technology has enabled the analysis, recognition, and interpretation of images in ways that were previously inconceivable. An investigation into the most recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques that have improved the efficiency and precision of image processing tasks is presented in this study. We survey the emergence of transformer architectures and the integration of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to explore how these technologies have transformed the understanding and application of images in several industries. An overview of existing image processing methods and the limits of those approaches is presented at the beginning of our research. This highlights the necessity of more advanced AI-driven solutions. After that, we examine the advancements that have been made in artificial intelligence, such as the incorporation of attention processes, the development of more effective CNN architectures, and the utilisation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the purpose of picture synthesis and augmentation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact that artificial intelligence has on particular applications of image processing, such as autonomous car navigation systems, facial recognition, medical imaging, and satellite images analysis. Specifically, we focus on the enhancements in diagnostic accuracy, environmental monitoring, security, and safety that arose as a result of the adoption of artificial intelligence in these sectors through the use of case studies. Furthermore, we discuss the issues that are associated with artificial intelligence in image processing. These challenges include the necessity for explainable AI models, the requirement for computational resources, and the protection of data privacy. A number of potential solutions to these problems are proposed by us, including federated learning and the creation of artificial intelligence systems that are more open to scrutiny. Lastly, we come to a conclusion by predicting future developments in artificial intelligence for image processing. These developments include the ability of AI to offer more personalised and adaptable image processing solutions, as well as the integration of AI with edge computing for real-time image analysis. The results of our research highlight the significant role that artificial intelligence plays in the development of image processing skills, which has far-reaching ramifications for the fields of technology, industry, and society.},

The hiring process is a crucial aspect of any organization, as it determines the quality of the workforce and the success of the business. However, traditional hiring methods can be time-consuming and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose a better approach to hiring that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate and improve the efficiency of the process. Our proposed system allows managers to specify their requirements and receive a shortlist of candidates based on their skills, experience, and performance in a one-on-one interview with a photorealistic artificial intelligence bot. The bot also assesses candidates’ confidence and body language to rank them accordingly. By using AI and machine learning in the hiring process, we can save time and reduce bias, leading to better-quality hires and a more productive workforce.},

  abstract={Deep generative models have risen to prominence in diverse domains, including healthcare. In particular, their application in causal effect estimation has the potential to drive significant advancements in personalized medicine. In this study, we conducted an empirical analysis to investigate the impact of selection bias on continuous treatment effect estimation using deep generative models. Our results demonstrate that the presence of selection bias can lead to estimation performance disparities of up to 8 to 9 times. Such significant deviations pose severe risks in medical applications, where accurate treatment effect estimation is crucial for patient outcomes. Therefore, this paper underscores the criticality of addressing these challenges and proposes directions for future research to ensure the robust application of AI in healthcare.},

  abstract={This study examines the structure of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and factors influencing students’ attitudes, readiness, and perceived relevance of AI in higher education at Central European universities. The research, based on data from 1,195 students enrolled in various study programs between 2022 and 2024, examines how variables such as gender, academic discipline, and year of study influence perceptions related to AI. A validated questionnaire targeting constructs including satisfaction, readiness, and relevance of AI was used. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify significant differences between groups, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc analysis. The findings reveal consistent differences across genders and disciplines, with males and IT students demonstrating significantly higher readiness and satisfaction with AI. Furthermore, satisfaction levels fluctuated over time, peaking in 2023 – likely influenced by the widespread adoption of tools like ChatGPT. Correlation analysis further highlighted the subtle interrelationships between constructs across different subgroups. The study underscores the importance of tailored AI education strategies and calls for targeted interventions to ensure equitable engagement with AI across diverse student populations.},

  abstract={The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by integrating AI attributes (“perceived anthropomorphism,” “perceived intelligence,” and “perceived animacy”) with the theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students’ attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects, and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various stakeholders.},

So far, GenAI enables us to automate and augment cognitive and creative jobs, including the work of doctors, designers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of GenAI transformation. But combine GenAI with robots and that may change. GenAI can help us tackle some of the biggest problems on the planet. Yes, GenAI can be used to draft a funny speech for our friend's wedding, or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases.</p>},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly developed, the phenomenon of ‘insight’ in AI systems has attracted sufficient research attention. In this study, I principally discuss on the relationship between the insight phenomenon in AI and Kant’s transcendental philosophy and develop a novel theoretical framework for it. This research is an analysis of how such a posteriori structures of Kant’s Transcendental Ideas allow us to understand problems solved by AI systems by analysing the procedural implementation of these systems, and how it, in turn, reveals the profound implication of such ideas on AI cognitive process. In the first step of this paper, the main concept of the insight phenomenon is explained, and then describes its recent applications in AI - as applied in deep learning for example, and natural language processing. Afterwards, it discusses how Kant’s transcendental philosophy can serve as theoretical rationalizations for AI’s abilities of learning, reasoning and innovation especially in building knowledge representation and reasoning frameworks. The final part of the study describes concrete means of applying the Kantian philosophical ideas to the AI system design, introducing new levels of AI optimization. The results indicate that Kant’s a priori framework thus allows to augment the cognitive potential of AI systems and, at the same time, to seed an interdisciplinary dialogue, thereby paving the way to AI’s future development.},

  abstract={Personalized learning refers to a system of teaching and learning where the content, methods, and assessment are tailored to each learner's needs, capacities/skills/competencies, and pace. There is abundant literature about personalized learning, describing its advantages, challenges, and approaches to implementing it. This study has explored the abundant literature and realized that while there are substantial proposed ways to achieve personalized learning, these proposals are not implemented into actionable products. This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the “Custom GPT” component has been implemented and tested on a course named “Applied Cryptography” in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues.},

  abstract={The fashion business is growing quickly and is one of the main forces behind the world's economies. The everexpanding business is driving a significant rise in the application of computer science to address various issues inside it. It becomes difficult to discover a personalized wardrobe that reflects their preferences, taste and needs. Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed.

  abstract={Software developer's approaches to coding, testing, and deployment are changing due to the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software development. AI-Augmented Software Development Tools simplify repetitive activities, boost productivity, and lessen the cognitive load on developers by utilizing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and other AI techniques. These tools support several development phases, including DevOps optimization, testing automation, problem discovery, and code generation. For example, AI-driven systems find flaws and inefficiencies in the code, while AI-powered code generation tools like GitHub Copilot help with code suggestion and completion. Additionally, AI automates debugging and test case creation, ensuring the scalability and dependability of software systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) improves quality assurance in complex contexts such as microservices and APIs by maximizing test coverage and identifying abnormalities. Additionally, AI-powered assistants help guide engineers through code inspections, security checks, and performance optimization. Notwithstanding these advantages, there are drawbacks to using AI tools, such as privacy issues and an excessive reliance on automation. With continued development, these tools have the potential to not only expedite development but also redirect the developer's attention towards more complex problem resolution, thereby transforming software engineering methodologies.

  abstract={Despite the myriad peer-reviewed papers demonstrating novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, few have made a significant clinical impact, especially in diagnosis and disease precision staging. One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.},

  pages={867-871},
  abstract={Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models face significant challenges in abstract reasoning tasks, which require deep understanding and generalization across a wide range of domains. This study introduces a novel hybrid multicomponent architecture designed to enhance AGI performance on abstract reasoning tasks. The proposed model integrates advanced techniques including Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each component addresses distinct aspects of the task: Transformers capture sequence dependencies, GNNs model complex relationships between entities, GANs generate realistic data for training, and RL optimizes reasoning strategies. The synergy of these components allows the model to achieve strong generalization and abstract learning capabilities, significantly improving performance compared to single-component models. The experimental results on the ARC-AGI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid approach, with marked improvements in key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and AUC-ROC. These results confirm that the proposed model is a promising solution to overcoming the limitations of current AGI systems in tackling novel and complex reasoning tasks. Future work will focus on further optimization of the model components, expanding its scope to more complex tasks, and evaluating its performance in practical applications such as natural language understanding and robotics.},

  abstract={Cancer is a multifactorial disease, associated with several alterations at various molecular levels, which provides a favorable and selective advantage for aberrant cell growth. Enormous genetic alterations in cancer can be captured through next-generation sequencing. The analysis of high-dimensional data from sequencing experiments requires a huge amount of computational power, which can be addressed using algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). Early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have been instrumental in clinical research due to its ability to assist clinicians to make a more informed treatment decision. The visualization of tumor growth and its genetic cause is an essential part of cancer treatment. Here, AI/ML can address this by analyzing and linking the image-derived data to genomics data from cancer patients. In this work, we present a review of recent advances in image analysis using ML/AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to that, we have discussed the recent methods of genomic data analysis for cancer classification and biomarker discovery.},

  abstract={While the world remains fascinated by the technology and ingenuity behind Artificial Intelligence (AI), certain drawbacks prompt us to question its impact on humanity. One major drawback encountered is bias and lack of inclusivity. Recently, there have been instances where AI systems lacked equality, equity, and honesty in their results for specific operations. Given these events and the global advancement of AI applications, it is crucial to investigate the causes of bias in deployed models. To this end, we considered the model pretraining stage as the major cause of this challenge and identified the lack of non-Western datasets as a vital reason. This research aims to promote inclusivity by providing a food images dataset from Nigeria and a deep learning classification model trained on this dataset.},

Notably, artificial intelligence is playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing semiconductor manufacturing. The recent focus has been on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for managing semi-conductor defects. We aimed to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, spotlighting trends in AI research within the semiconductor domain, particularly concerning defects. We gathered pertinent publications from Scopus and Web of Science databases, meticulously examining their distributions. Our findings encompass a total of 808 papers published between 2019 and 2023. Over this five-year span, publications exhibit consistent growth, with Proceedings of SPIE and IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing emerging as the most prolific sources as per Scopus and Web of Science data. Additionally, we scrutinized influential research approaches and data resources outlined in top-tier publications. The study underscores the persistent expansion of this research realm and outlines three principal insights and three extant limitations associated with employing AI for semiconductor defect control.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to deeply explore the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) application in interactive User Interface (UI) design, and evaluate its effect in conceptual design, prototype design and final design through experiments and analysis. By introducing generative design tools, machine learning algorithms and sentiment analysis technology, this study evaluates the role of AI in improving design efficiency, personalizing user experience, increasing creativity and enhancing emotional resonance of users. In the evaluation of design effect, it is found that the effect score is significantly improved after the introduction of AI in each design stage. The design scheme generated by the designer through AI is more in line with the needs of users, the design accuracy is improved, and the creativity is also increased compared with the traditional design. In terms of personalized user experience, we use machine learning algorithm to adjust interface elements according to user behavior to provide a more personalized user experience. The experimental results show that personalized design can significantly improve user satisfaction and interaction efficiency. Through the emotional analysis technology, the language and emotional tone of the design are adjusted, and the emotional resonance of users is improved. Designers can better express their emotions and make the design more in line with the emotional needs of users. On the whole, this study provides an in-depth empirical study on the application of AI in UI design, and provides beneficial enlightenment for future intelligent design and user experience research.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, people more and more rely on generative AI (GenAI) to fulfill a variety of tasks. Thus, the popularity of AI is arousing people’s attention to AI literacy. However, few current existing studies or scientific methods can systematically summarize AI literacy systematically. Therefore, aiming to use library statistic-based clustering techniques to analyze AI literacy, this paper uses clustering to perform summarizing based on library statistic analysis rules. Subsequently, bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer visualization tools are used to conduct a comprehensive review of the academic literature in the field of AI literacy. With better parameters and rules, the summary proposed in this paper can outperform the baseline clustering models. Experimental results show that better summaries can be obtained and visualized by using our proposed method. Additionally, this study points out the limitations of the research and provides direction for improvement in subsequent studies.},
