  abstract={The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has accelerated the reform in the field of education and opened up a new development path for English writing teaching in middle schools. However, in the actual teaching process, there are still problems with the rigid application of artificial intelligence and the lack of data support for learning situation analysis. Therefore, exploring the deep integration model of generative artificial intelligence technology and English writing teaching in middle schools is particularly urgent. By the theory of process-genre approach and blended teaching model, we construct a teaching model of middle school English writing assisted by generative artificial intelligence from three dimensions: teaching resources, teaching process and teaching evaluation. This teaching model realizes the enrichment and personalization of teaching resources, integrates generative artificial intelligence into every step of the teaching process, and comprehensively improves the teaching efficiency and quality of English writing in middle school.},

The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},

  title={Research on Clothing Sketch Conversion Based on Generative Adversarial Networks}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.},

  abstract={Programming education has gained prominence in the intelligent era, yet students frequently encounter coding errors and struggle with algorithm comprehension, which diminishes their learning engagement. Although generative AI has brought new vitality to programming instruction, its concrete impacts demand further exploration. This study developed three distinct AI-powered learning strategies - Inquiry Learning, Collaborative Learning and Dialogic Learning - to establish a Generative AI Programming Teaching Model specifically for junior high students. Using a quasi-experimental approach, the research compared the effectiveness of this AI teaching model against traditional methods by implementing them in separate seventh-grade classes at a Y City middle school. The results of the study show that (1) The holistic application of generative AI learning strategies significantly enhanced junior high school students' programming learning engagement. (2) Generative AI learning strategies can enhance middle school students' emotional engagement. (3) Generative AI learning strategies can enhance middle school students' cognitive engagement. (4) Generative AI learning strategies can enhance middle school students' behavioral engagement. The study makes recommendations for the experimental results in order to provide references for improving programming learning engagement.},

  abstract={While education and technology currently work hand in hand thanks to educational technology, there's a conflict when students want to use a technology that's prohibited by the teachers, usually because of the implications that a new technology (specifically, artificial intelligence tools) can have in the educational development of the students. In this regard, the present paper seeks to propose and describe the current considerations that need to be considered when including artificial intelligence tools and technologies in educational contexts. From the research, it was identified that it is essential to emphasize that artificial intelligence does not seek to replace teachers, but to complement their work, and that artificial intelligence should be used ethically by students and teachers in ways that result beneficial for teaching and learning alike.},

  abstract={With the proposal of carbon neutrality, more and more new energy sources are used. Assessing the stability of power systems integrated with these new energy sources has become an urgent issue. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence-based method for steady-state analysis of power systems was proposed. This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model. The final result is verified by the actual data of East China Power Grid, which shows the feasibility of the artificial intelligence algorithm.},

This paper discusses the problems of data security, bias and the implantation of morality and values in the ethics of artificial intelligence algorithms, and systematically and comprehensively expounds the main solutions to these three problems. It is found that the current three major technical paths for solving the data security issues have the problems of high dependency, large computation and communication overhead, and limited applicability, and the future trend is the integration and development of the three paths; the solution of the bias problem needs to be improved in terms of interpretability under the condition that the underlying fairness is difficult to be determined; and it is difficult for the implantation of morality and values to take into account the learning ability, adaptability, and interpretability at the same time. Finally, this paper analyzes and looks forward to the development of AI ethics, hoping to provide lessons and references for AI ethics-related research.},

  abstract={Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1562-1573},
  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  abstract={This study conducts a systematic comparative analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in primary music education between China and Korea. Utilizing a mixed-methods framework, the research examines policy frameworks, pedagogical implementations, and educator perceptions through policy document analysis, classroom observations, and semi-structured interviews with 20 music educators. Findings reveal that while both nations leverage AI to address challenges such as large class sizes and resource disparities, China emphasizes standardized AI platforms to enhance equity in rural education, whereas Korea prioritizes teacher-designed AI applications to foster urban innovation. Notably, Korean educators report a 34% higher incidence of AI-facilitated collaborative composition activities compared to their Chinese counterparts (p<0.05). However, systemic barriers including uneven teacher training and technological infrastructure persist in rural regions. This study contributes to the global dialogue on AI in arts education by proposing a culturally responsive implementation framework that balances technological innovation with pedagogical sustainability.},

  abstract={The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.},

Like any AI, GenAI tools are given enormous amounts of data to learn from (what's known as &#x201c;training data&#x201d;). Generative adversarial networks work by pitting two competing algorithms against each other, one tasked with generating data that resembles its training data and the other tasked with trying to tell whether the output is real or generated. Alongside ChatGPT, there are other generative text tools like Google's Bard and Meta's Llama. These tools can be used to write anything from essays and articles, to plays, poems, and novels. GenAI makes it easy to create entirely synthetic data for use in training other AI models.</p>},

Generative AI provides a new solution for the audit field. To this end, this paper proposes a research plan for audit data analysis and risk identification based on generative AI technology. This study first outlines the application of generative AI in auditing. Then, variational inference is introduced using VAEs to approximate the probability distribution of audit data. In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.},

  abstract={For trusted AI, the AI academic community has set up related technical communities, including AcmFacct, Fair & Responsible AI CHI2020, RAI ICLR, etc. However, the sample set adopted by the research in the field of general artificial intelligence technology lacks the coverage of power vision data, which is divorced from the actual power vision scene, and ignores the influence of the evil, diversity and complexity of the outdoor environment of power vision on the model decision credibility, which makes the existing credibility evaluation tools unable to be directly applied to the actual power vision scene. At the same time, there is a lack of critical technical research and support within the industry to accurately measure the model's ability to provide reliable service in real power business scenarios. Through the effective evaluation of the adversarial robustness of the power vision model under three different strategies: white box, grey box and black box, the performance of the power vision model under adversarial attack is verified, and the security and reliability of the power vision model in key power scenario applications are guaranteed, the security risks of the model are reduced, and the reliability of model users on model output decisions is improved. In turn, it can enhance the confidence of users, accumulate more high-quality data in the process of frequent use and sustainable training, and improve the ability of artificial intelligence models, which complement each other, and finally make artificial intelligence technology fully land in the power grid, so that the power grid can enter the intelligent era as soon as possible.},

Adopting the Task-Technology Fit Theory, the research evaluates how AI characteristics (adaptivity, iteration capabilities, learning ability, quality of content) and human traits (self-efficacy, personal innovativeness) influence AI reliance and performance outcomes. A sample survey of 148 middle-level IT employees reveals that AI reliance significantly enhances performance through improved task knowledge validation and higher self-efficacy. While AI’s adaptive and iterative features do not substantially impact reliance, task knowledge validation, and personal innovativeness emerge as crucial factors.

We first reviewed the theoretical foundations of multimodality in human learning, encompassing its concept and history, dual coding theory and multimedia theory, VARK multimodality, and multimodal assessment (see Section II-A). After that, we revisited the essential components of AGI, particularly focusing on the multimodal nature of AGI that distinguished it from artificial narrow intelligence. Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III–VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation. Specific data show that the recommendation accuracy of the system reaches 92%, the learning efficiency is improved by 15%, and the student satisfaction is 20% higher than the traditional learning model.},

  abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence, the governance of false and harmful information in cyberspace has become more urgent due to the development of content generation technologies. Therefore, the monitoring techniques for false and harmful information has become an important research topic. The core principle of false and harmful information monitoring technology is the integration of content feature extraction and monitoring algorithms. Allowing the generation and dissemination of false and harmful information poses potential threats to social stability and the legitimate rights and interests of others. The technical reasons for the generation of false and harmful information are that the quality of training data sets affects the authenticity of output content, the capabilities of deep learning models accelerate the generation of false and harmful information, and the lag in the update of training data sets makes it difficult to detect false news in new contexts. Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues through a comprehensive governance approach combining technology and law to achieve the healthy development of cyberspace in the era of artificial intelligence.},

Looking ahead beyond GenAI, we envision a future AI landscape composed of semantic communications, collaborative GenAI and discriminative agents. We also examine the challenges related to scalability and complexity that must be overcome to achieve sustainable AI deployments. Finally, we highlight the significance of emerging computing technologies and frameworks, such as quantum and neuromorphic computing, that play a pivotal role in the broader trajectory towards artificial general intelligence.},

  abstract={As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

  abstract={An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including large language and image models, have created new opportunities for pervasive computing education. How do we integrate emerging AI models and tools into our courses in a way that fosters critical engagement? How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human–computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

However, integration into the industry processes is happening at a slow pace. This paper represents a survey conducted with 163 industrial engineers on the use of AI in product development. The questionnaire specifically focuses on the early phase of product development and investigates the current state, challenges and potentials. The results show a high level of interest in the use of AI, but integration into everyday working processes has been low so far. Among the few who incorporate AI into their concept development processes, an indication to shorter concept development times was observed. The automation of routine tasks and a conflicting requirements detection are seen as particularly promising AI applications. Main challenges and barriers lie in the expertise of employees, the costs of implementation and the usability of data. Nevertheless, more than two thirds state that further AI integration is planned.

  abstract={A new wave of artificial intelligence applications that offer extensive benefits to our daily lives has been led to by dramatic success in machine learning. The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},

  pages={1796-1801},
  abstract={This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

The cybersecurity landscape is quickly changing, encompassing AI&#x2010;powered malware, adversarial ML techniques, AI&#x2010;enabled botnets, and intensified insider threats. Cyber threats were growing globally faster than cyber defensive capabilities even before AI arose and was used. Cyberattacks in the past required much manual investigation, labour&#x2010;intensive planning, and patience. Cybercriminals are also taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem of the growing networks of connected devices. Cyberattacks will become more sophisticated as result of generative AI, increasing the possibility of ransomware&#x2010;as&#x2010;a&#x2010;service, phishing, malware development, deepfakes, and the exposing of personally identifying information. Another kind of adversarial attack in the context of AI and ML models is AI poisoning. Polymorphic malware leverages polymorphism to evade detection instead of optimizing its effectiveness.</p>},

  abstract={Generative AI (GAI) is one of the significant components that can efficiently improve and augment the AI cycle model’s robustness when it comes to different threats, weaknesses, and abnormalities detection. When applied in this field, GAI is very useful in emulating the various forms of security violations in actual adversarial settings. These scenarios are important when different aspects of an AI system are tested on how robust they are and thus permit the developers to amend any vulnerability that may be induced before the time it could be utilized in practice. Data and model manipulation, data theft, and adversarial attacks as well as model inference threats which we do a systematic analysis to disrupt the integrity, confidentiality as well as availability of AI models. Considering the current weaknesses and threats related to GAI we provide a systematic approach to how safety concerns that are currently relevant can be integrated with every stage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle management: from continuous monitoring to the application of cybersecurity trends and practices, etc. In our approach, the emphasis is placed on the multi-level security management strategy that incorporates the improvement of coding practices, validation and testing, and the implementation of advanced intrusion detection systems. Before proceeding to further analysis and discussion of the given topic, it is also critical to mention the aspect of regulation and ethical concern as the major drivers of GAI usage. Additionally, organizations can involve GAI in the lifecycle to address security needs, during the development, acquisition, deployment, updating, maintenance, and decommissioning of the AI system, making them reliable, safe, and secure all through their lifecycle. Toward these ends, the goal of this work is to present a set of canonical recommendations for the many scientists, engineers, managers, technologists, and policymakers who will play a key role in constructing a sound and secure AI future.},

  abstract={The research on computer vision mainly aims to enable computers to understand and interpret images. Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image. This article provided a reference for the research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in visual effects.},

  abstract={Integrating emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), into university teaching and learning processes is becoming a crucial component of modern education. Generative AI models like ChatGPT have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing learning experiences by providing personalized, interactive, and adaptive education. However, the adoption of these advancements varies across regions due to differences in infrastructure, regulations, and resource access. This study addresses the need for a tailored policy framework to facilitate the adoption of generative AI in higher education institutions. It investigates the policy elements that enable the use and accessibility of these technologies, aiming to develop a comprehensive framework to guide the integration of AI in teaching. The proposed framework, with its focus on addressing educational disparities, seeks to ensure the strategic, responsible, and effective use of AI technologies, thereby improving the overall quality of education. A mixed-method approach was employed, integrating a systematic review and qualitative interviews to explore and propose a policy framework for adopting emerging technologies, particularly generative AI. It utilized primary and secondary data, with a comprehensive literature review identifying policy issues and input from 10 university experts verifying the policy items. The research identified ten key policy components categorized into three dimensions: governance, operation, and pedagogy, and discussed their implications. The conclusion emphasizes that incorporating AI through well-crafted policies significantly impacts its strategic integration in education. This study underscores the necessity of localized policy to fully harness the potential of emerging technologies in various educational contexts.},

  abstract={We are at the dawn of a new area of AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), which holds the potential to automate and generate in ways never before possible and can be applied across countless disciplines from natural language processing (NLP) to image synthesis, interactive simulations, and more. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks and transformers, as well as cutting edge AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, DALL-E, Gemini, and Bing Copilot have made content generation a different game. From realizing intelligent code generation, realistic image synthesis, or personalized search, these tools are transforming industries to software development and digital art, to search engines. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of generative AI technologies and the methodologies behind these technologies, including attention mechanisms, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and transformer-based models such as GPT and BERT. The paper also discusses the implementation of generative AI across Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, highlighting how the use of AI to generate content is revolutionizing the interactive experiences in gaming, education, and training. In the study we also perform performance evaluations of generative AI models on benchmark datasets using BLEU, ROUGE scores etc. We discuss some of the challenges facing generative AI on ethical, computational, and too-often opaque lines and predict that generative AI can transform industries by creating autonomous creativity and personalized learning.},
