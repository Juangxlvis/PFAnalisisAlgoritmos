However, in the actual teaching process, there are still problems with the rigid application of artificial intelligence and the lack of data support for learning situation analysis. Therefore, exploring the deep integration model of generative artificial intelligence technology and English writing teaching in middle schools is particularly urgent. By the theory of process-genre approach and blended teaching model, we construct a teaching model of middle school English writing assisted by generative artificial intelligence from three dimensions: teaching resources, teaching process and teaching evaluation. This teaching model realizes the enrichment and personalization of teaching resources, integrates generative artificial intelligence into every step of the teaching process, and comprehensively improves the teaching efficiency and quality of English writing in middle school.},

    abstract = {The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image.

Assessing the stability of power systems integrated with these new energy sources has become an urgent issue. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence-based method for steady-state analysis of power systems was proposed. This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model. The final result is verified by the actual data of East China Power Grid, which shows the feasibility of the artificial intelligence algorithm.},

Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text.

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K\textendash 12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt.

Generative AI provides a new solution for the audit field. To this end, this paper proposes a research plan for audit data analysis and risk identification based on generative AI technology. This study first outlines the application of generative AI in auditing. Then, variational inference is introduced using VAEs to approximate the probability distribution of audit data. In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.},

Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III\textendash VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

The core principle of false and harmful information monitoring technology is the integration of content feature extraction and monitoring algorithms. Allowing the generation and dissemination of false and harmful information poses potential threats to social stability and the legitimate rights and interests of others. The technical reasons for the generation of false and harmful information are that the quality of training data sets affects the authenticity of output content, the capabilities of deep learning models accelerate the generation of false and harmful information, and the lag in the update of training data sets makes it difficult to detect false news in new contexts.

    abstract = {As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00.

    abstract = {We are at the dawn of a new area of AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), which holds the potential to automate and generate in ways never before possible and can be applied across countless disciplines from natural language processing (NLP) to image synthesis, interactive simulations, and more. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks and transformers, as well as cutting edge AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, DALL-E, Gemini, and Bing Copilot have made content generation a different game. From realizing intelligent code generation, realistic image synthesis, or personalized search, these tools are transforming industries to software development and digital art, to search engines. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of generative AI technologies and the methodologies behind these technologies, including attention mechanisms, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and transformer-based models such as GPT and BERT. The paper also discusses the implementation of generative AI across Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, highlighting how the use of AI to generate content is revolutionizing the interactive experiences in gaming, education, and training. In the study we also perform performance evaluations of generative AI models on benchmark datasets using BLEU, ROUGE scores etc. We discuss some of the challenges facing generative AI on ethical, computational, and too-often opaque lines and predict that generative AI can transform industries by creating autonomous creativity and personalized learning.},

This study focuses on 55 pre-service teachers, employing lag sequential analysis and content analysis to examine their recorded collaboration processes and reflective texts. The aim is to explore the behavior patterns and characteristics of human-machine collaboration based on GAI. The findings indicate that the sequence C2\rightarrow C1/C5\rightarrow C3/C4\rightarrow  C2 represents an efficient human-machine collaboration behavior pattern, in which pre-service teachers ask GAI questions, refine its responses based on their understanding, and iteratively collaborate to optimize lesson plans. The advantages of GAI in this collaboration include efficiency, comprehensive knowledge, clear logic, and lack of temporal and spatial constraints. However, its disadvantages are poor comprehension, limited professionalism, lack of personalization and innovation, reduced sense of communication, and technological limitations. The results provide significant insights for optimizing educational practices through collaboration between pre-service teachers and GAI.},

    abstract = {A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50\% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company\textquotesingle s stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},

While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33\%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11\%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research.

However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students\textquotesingle  perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students\textquotesingle  learning capacity.},

In particular, social computing was significantly influenced by the recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the conventional technologies of AI have various drawbacks in dealing with complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows some advantages over the conventional AI. This article firstly reviews the latest research progresses of AI in social computing. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges AI faces in social computing, which motivate the necessity to introduce H-AI to tackle social-oriented problems. Finally, we discuss the concept of H-AI and propose a holistic architecture of H-AI in social computing, which consists of three layers: object layer, intelligent processing layer, and application layer. The proposed architecture shows that H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.},

At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs. This paper also uses a style transfer algorithm to combine user-favorite elements with design templates to generate preliminary design sketches. Then GAN intervenes to generate new design elements and uses these elements to enrich and refine the design content. During the design process, the artificial intelligence model is continuously optimized based on user feedback to ensure that the final output design not only meets the user\textquotesingle s personalized needs but is also highly innovative and attractive. Ultimately, these individually adjusted designs are output in an appropriate format for application in actual products or services. Based on comparative experiments, this paper found that personalized design is superior to traditional design methods in multiple key indicators: the average innovation score of personalized design is as high as 9.06, higher than the 6.89 of traditional design; the time required for personalized design is mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 minutes, while the time required for traditional design ranges from 30 to nearly 50 minutes and fluctuates greatly; the adoption rate of personalized design reaches a minimum of 90.2\% and a maximum of 99.9\%, while the adoption rate of traditional design is lower, with a minimum of only 75.2\% and a maximum of only 88.7\%.

The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process.

However, a rapidly growing interest lies in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to brainstorm new product and service ideas. This study conducts a comparative analysis of ideas generated by human professionals and an AI system. The results of a blind expert evaluation show that AI-generated ideas score significantly higher in novelty and customer benefit, while their feasibility scores are similar to those of human ideas. Overall, AI-generated ideas comprise the majority of the top-performing ideas, while human-generated ideas scored lower than expected. The executive\textquotesingle s emotional and cognitive reactions were measured during the evaluation to check for potential biases and showed no differences between the idea groups. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, companies can benefit from integrating generative AI into their traditional idea-generation processes.},

Indeed, AI technologies offer unprecedented capacities to analyze huge amounts of historical data, enabling researchers and art historians to uncover precious patterns, connections, and insights that might otherwise remain elusive. Also, the efficiency and accuracy of AI techniques play a pivotal role in many cultural heritage-related tasks, such as cataloging and organizing extensive cultural collections, streamlining the management of heritage resources for present and future generations. However, the integration of AI in cultural heritage also brings forth intricate ethical questions. These span over the issues of authenticity, subjectivity, and interpretation biases of an AI-empowered, reproduced, and/or generated artwork up to the legal concerns related to authorship. However, such issues are mostly undefined and unaddressed in the scholarship at the intersection on AI, ethics, and cultural heritage. This paper aims to pave the way to fill such a gap of context-sensitive ethical issues for AI in cultural heritage. To this aim, the paper first analyzes the main opportunities and benefits raised by AI in cultural heritage. Then, matching benchmark, agreed-upon AI ethics principles elaborated in the AI ethics scholarship in the last decade and relevant to cultural heritage, it highlights specific ethical risks that ought to be considered for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI in and for cultural heritage. Finally, areas requiring further attention and work, and actors call to intervene, are identified to facilitate next steps for ethics and governance of AI in cultural heritage.},

This revolutionary technology has enabled the analysis, recognition, and interpretation of images in ways that were previously inconceivable. An investigation into the most recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques that have improved the efficiency and precision of image processing tasks is presented in this study. We survey the emergence of transformer architectures and the integration of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to explore how these technologies have transformed the understanding and application of images in several industries. An overview of existing image processing methods and the limits of those approaches is presented at the beginning of our research. This highlights the necessity of more advanced AI-driven solutions. After that, we examine the advancements that have been made in artificial intelligence, such as the incorporation of attention processes, the development of more effective CNN architectures, and the utilisation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the purpose of picture synthesis and augmentation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact that artificial intelligence has on particular applications of image processing, such as autonomous car navigation systems, facial recognition, medical imaging, and satellite images analysis. Specifically, we focus on the enhancements in diagnostic accuracy, environmental monitoring, security, and safety that arose as a result of the adoption of artificial intelligence in these sectors through the use of case studies. Furthermore, we discuss the issues that are associated with artificial intelligence in image processing. These challenges include the necessity for explainable AI models, the requirement for computational resources, and the protection of data privacy. A number of potential solutions to these problems are proposed by us, including federated learning and the creation of artificial intelligence systems that are more open to scrutiny. Lastly, we come to a conclusion by predicting future developments in artificial intelligence for image processing. These developments include the ability of AI to offer more personalised and adaptable image processing solutions, as well as the integration of AI with edge computing for real-time image analysis.

In this study, we conducted an empirical analysis to investigate the impact of selection bias on continuous treatment effect estimation using deep generative models. Our results demonstrate that the presence of selection bias can lead to estimation performance disparities of up to 8 to 9 times. Such significant deviations pose severe risks in medical applications, where accurate treatment effect estimation is crucial for patient outcomes. Therefore, this paper underscores the criticality of addressing these challenges and proposes directions for future research to ensure the robust application of AI in healthcare.},

In this study, I principally discuss on the relationship between the insight phenomenon in AI and Kant’s transcendental philosophy and develop a novel theoretical framework for it. This research is an analysis of how such a posteriori structures of Kant’s Transcendental Ideas allow us to understand problems solved by AI systems by analysing the procedural implementation of these systems, and how it, in turn, reveals the profound implication of such ideas on AI cognitive process. In the first step of this paper, the main concept of the insight phenomenon is explained, and then describes its recent applications in AI - as applied in deep learning for example, and natural language processing. Afterwards, it discusses how Kant’s transcendental philosophy can serve as theoretical rationalizations for AI’s abilities of learning, reasoning and innovation especially in building knowledge representation and reasoning frameworks. The final part of the study describes concrete means of applying the Kantian philosophical ideas to the AI system design, introducing new levels of AI optimization. The results indicate that Kant’s a priori framework thus allows to augment the cognitive potential of AI systems and, at the same time, to seed an interdisciplinary dialogue, thereby paving the way to AI’s future development.},

Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity.

One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation.

    abstract = {Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models face significant challenges in abstract reasoning tasks, which require deep understanding and generalization across a wide range of domains. This study introduces a novel hybrid multicomponent architecture designed to enhance AGI performance on abstract reasoning tasks. The proposed model integrates advanced techniques including Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each component addresses distinct aspects of the task: Transformers capture sequence dependencies, GNNs model complex relationships between entities, GANs generate realistic data for training, and RL optimizes reasoning strategies. The synergy of these components allows the model to achieve strong generalization and abstract learning capabilities, significantly improving performance compared to single-component models. The experimental results on the ARC-AGI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid approach, with marked improvements in key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and AUC-ROC. These results confirm that the proposed model is a promising solution to overcoming the limitations of current AGI systems in tackling novel and complex reasoning tasks. Future work will focus on further optimization of the model components, expanding its scope to more complex tasks, and evaluating its performance in practical applications such as natural language understanding and robotics.},

    abstract = {The rapid progress of science and technology, coupled with the integration of artificial intelligence, is driving transformative shifts within the manufacturing sector. Notably, artificial intelligence is playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing semiconductor manufacturing. The recent focus has been on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for managing semi-conductor defects. We aimed to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, spotlighting trends in AI research within the semiconductor domain, particularly concerning defects. We gathered pertinent publications from Scopus and Web of Science databases, meticulously examining their distributions. Our findings encompass a total of 808 papers published between 2019 and 2023. Over this five-year span, publications exhibit consistent growth, with Proceedings of SPIE and IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing emerging as the most prolific sources as per Scopus and Web of Science data. Additionally, we scrutinized influential research approaches and data resources outlined in top-tier publications. The study underscores the persistent expansion of this research realm and outlines three principal insights and three extant limitations associated with employing AI for semiconductor defect control.},

    abstract = {The purpose of this study is to deeply explore the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) application in interactive User Interface (UI) design, and evaluate its effect in conceptual design, prototype design and final design through experiments and analysis. By introducing generative design tools, machine learning algorithms and sentiment analysis technology, this study evaluates the role of AI in improving design efficiency, personalizing user experience, increasing creativity and enhancing emotional resonance of users. In the evaluation of design effect, it is found that the effect score is significantly improved after the introduction of AI in each design stage. The design scheme generated by the designer through AI is more in line with the needs of users, the design accuracy is improved, and the creativity is also increased compared with the traditional design. In terms of personalized user experience, we use machine learning algorithm to adjust interface elements according to user behavior to provide a more personalized user experience. The experimental results show that personalized design can significantly improve user satisfaction and interaction efficiency. Through the emotional analysis technology, the language and emotional tone of the design are adjusted, and the emotional resonance of users is improved. Designers can better express their emotions and make the design more in line with the emotional needs of users. On the whole, this study provides an in-depth empirical study on the application of AI in UI design, and provides beneficial enlightenment for future intelligent design and user experience research.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, people more and more rely on generative AI (GenAI) to fulfill a variety of tasks. Thus, the popularity of AI is arousing people’s attention to AI literacy. However, few current existing studies or scientific methods can systematically summarize AI literacy systematically. Therefore, aiming to use library statistic-based clustering techniques to analyze AI literacy, this paper uses clustering to perform summarizing based on library statistic analysis rules. Subsequently, bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer visualization tools are used to conduct a comprehensive review of the academic literature in the field of AI literacy. With better parameters and rules, the summary proposed in this paper can outperform the baseline clustering models. Experimental results show that better summaries can be obtained and visualized by using our proposed method. Additionally, this study points out the limitations of the research and provides direction for improvement in subsequent studies.},

This study focused on the use of ChatGPT by undergraduate management students. We developed a model called the \textquotedblleft AI Student Satisfaction with Studies model\textquotedblright  (AI 3S-model) to investigate how generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, affects student satisfaction with their management studies. Factors used in the model included AI-related student expectations, AI-related student job expectations, perceived quality of AI among students, and AI-related overall student satisfaction. An online questionnaire was administered to students from economics faculties at various universities in the Czech Republic. We deliberately focused on one specialized economics college and several large economics faculties. The sample comprised 231 respondents. To analyze the data, we applied covariance-based structural equation modelling using maximum likelihood estimation. Our findings indicate that two factors directly and positively affect overall student satisfaction with AI use: their perceived quality of studies and their expectations. Additionally, perceived quality acts as a significant mediator between student expectations and overall satisfaction, as well as between job expectations and overall satisfaction. Students believe that ChatGPT enhances their quality of education, which boosts their overall satisfaction. For management education programs, this means that finding ways to effectively integrate generative AI into students’ learning and establishing reasonable limits is highly beneficial, whereas prohibiting the use of generative AI tools would likely decrease student satisfaction and diminish the perceived quality of their studies.},

    abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.},

The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5{'} UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5{'} UTR sequences and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5{'} UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by \sim 200\%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for mRNA 5{'} UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed online.},

This paper presents a systematic review of 77 articles published on GenAI use in language testing and assessment, to synthesize assessment challenges, opportunities, and solutions involving GenAI. We review issues of GenAI in the domains of reliability, validity, fairness, and practicality in large-scale, local, and classroom-based assessments. Based on the findings from the systematic review, we identify principles and best practices of language assessment in the age of GenAI. Additionally, we provide future directions for assessment research and practice related to GenAI, with a focus on impact and sustainability of GenAI in language assessment across contexts. We caution researchers and practitioners about the danger of following the trend of incorporating GenAI in an unmeasured and unselective manner.},

This review aimed to explore the current state of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) use in simulation-based healthcare education through a comprehensive examination of GenAI types, applications and reported outcomes.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute’s methodological guidance. Six databases were searched from their inception until February 2025.
Results
We included 28 articles that were published between 2023 and 2025. Articles were mainly in the fields of medicine (n = 14) and nursing (n = 10). OpenAI’s GPT models were most frequently used to portray simulated characters and deliver automated feedback. GenAI-enhanced simulation was generally perceived as accurate, realistic and feasible, with some evidence supporting its use as a supplement to conventional simulation and to enhance learning outcomes. Perspectives, ethical considerations and recommendations for GenAI-enhanced simulation were also highlighted.
Conclusion
GenAI-enhanced simulation is gaining popularity and is likely to evolve alongside human-facilitated simulation. Future developments should focus on building AI expertise among simulation educators and harnessing the synergy between human intelligence and GenAI. Further rigorous research is needed to establish best practices.},

    abstract = {The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) integration into health care has accelerated with rapid advances in generative AI (genAI). Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human\textendash AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use.

    abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to systematically map the development methods, scope, and limitations of existing artificial intelligence (AI) reporting guidelines in medicine and to explore their applicability to generative AI (GAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs).
Study Design and Setting
We reported a scoping review adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Five information sources were searched, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, FAIRsharing, and Google Scholar, from inception to December 31, 2024. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data using a predefined Excel template. Data included guideline characteristics (eg, development methods, target audience, AI domain), adherence to EQUATOR Network recommendations, and consensus methodologies. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer.
Results
Sixty-eight AI reporting guidelines were included; 48.5\% focused on general AI, whereas only 7.4\% addressed GAI/LLMs. Methodological rigor was limited; 39.7\% described development processes, 42.6\% involved multidisciplinary experts, and 33.8\% followed EQUATOR recommendations. Significant overlap existed, particularly in medical imaging (20.6\% of guidelines). GAI-specific guidelines (14.7\%) lacked comprehensive coverage and methodological transparency.
Conclusion
Existing AI reporting guidelines in medicine have suboptimal methodological rigor, redundancy, and insufficient coverage of GAI applications. Future and updated guidelines should prioritize standardized development processes, multidisciplinary collaboration, and expanded focus on emerging AI technologies like LLMs.},

    abstract = {Objectives
Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on \textquotedblleft GAI for Nursing Research\textquotedblright  theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of renewable energy and electric vehicles, batteries, as the core components of electrochemical energy storage systems, have become a global focus in both scientific research and industrial sectors due to their critical impact on system efficiency and safety. However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.},

This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of undergraduate nursing students.
Background
Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited.
Design
A quasi-experimental study.
Methods
Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66).
Results
After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course.
Conclusion
GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.},

Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven materials discovery offers rapid design of novel material compositions, yet synthesis and characterization lag behind. Characterization, in particular, remains bottlenecked by labor-intensive experiments using expert-operated instruments that typically rely on electromagnetic spectroscopy. We introduce SpectroGen, a generative AI model for transmodality spectral generation, designed to accelerate materials characterization. SpectroGen generates high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra with 99\% correlation to ground truth and a root-mean-square error of 0.01 a.u. Its performance is driven by two key innovations: (1) a novel distribution-based physical prior and (2) a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. The prior simplifies complex structural inputs into interpretable Gaussian or Lorentzian distributions, while the VAE maps them into a physically grounded latent space for accurate spectral transformation. SpectroGen generalizes across spectral domains and promises rapid, accurate spectral predictions, potentially transforming high-throughput discovery in domains such as battery materials, catalysts, superconductors, and pharmaceuticals.},

This paper aims to explore the initial formation of organizing visions within digital platforms regarding the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education. It examines how these emerging visions align with official guidelines. Understanding the early development of these organizing visions and the consensus formation around official guidelines for GAI in education has significant research and practical implications.
Design/methodology/approach
The present study uses a multimethodological approach with qualitative content-coding and inductive thematic analysis of digital trace data from the social media platform X and deductive thematic analysis of guideline documents. It first examines organizing visions within digital platforms through 1,260 tweets, focusing on opportunities and challenges posed by GAI, particularly ChatGPT, in educational settings. The study then analyses practical guidelines from international organizations, governments, and universities.
Findings
The empirical findings demonstrate that, although all three Organizing Vision (OV) functions are present in the early development of OVs for GAI in education, early-stage online discourse predominantly emphasizes the legitimation function. The findings also indicate a noticeable alignment between the topics discussed in the early development of OVs for GAI in education and the official guidelines and policies issued by international organizations, governments, and universities worldwide, indicating the need for educational reform, and ethical considerations.

However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a \textquotesingle \textquotesingle marketing-information-product-individual\textquotesingle \textquotesingle  system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products.

In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products.

    abstract = {Background
This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 \%) and used it for general purposes (79.9 \%). However, only 16.2 \% actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 \% were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 \% felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 \% had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 \% viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.},

After the selection, evaluation and content analysis of each study, 74 articles were ultimately included in the systematic literature review. Seven industries were identified in which GAI has demonstrated impacts on workload, efficiency and labour productivity, with four sectors accounting for 80\% of the studies. The impacts of GAI reveal four trends, all of them key in POM: automation and optimisation of workflows; support in decision making; improvement in human-machine interactions; enhancement in communication. To fully apply the potential of this technology, it is necessary to continue researching and addressing the identified issues, including ethical, employment, privacy and information quality challenges.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) approach for creating modular skeletal frameworks, using vernacular bamboo stilt houses as examples to investigate an innovative methodological perspective. By transforming building skeletons to connected graphs, our method uses Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) and Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE) to generate 3D modular components based on spatial constraints set by users, such as axis grids and chosen room areas. The graph representation encodes structural elements as edges and their connections as nodes, maintaining critical dimensional constraints and spatial relationships. Using data from bamboo stilt houses built without architects, we make a specialized dataset of geometric skeletons for model training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the distribution of featured elements in building frameworks and in generating structurally sound designs, with GraphSAGE showing better performance compared to alternative methods. The probabilistic edge prediction approach allows for a collaborative human-AI design process, empowering designers while utilizing computational capabilities. The inherent flexibility of the graph-based representation makes it adaptable to a wide range of materials and scales.},

    abstract = {Background
The potential application of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the capacity of emergency consultants is gaining growing attention. This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version.
Methods
The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted.
Results
In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots \texttimes  15 dialogues \texttimes  4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14\textendash 49 \% for the baseline chatbot and 77\textendash 92 \% for the customised version (p \leq  0.039).
Conclusions
Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable.},

Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design.},

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that can lead to a physical, social, and economic burden. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, gained attention for its potential to support medical practice. However, concerns remain about the reliability and consistency of its responses. This study systematically reviews the existing evidence on the role of generative AI in IBD.
Materials and methods
We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020\textendash Sep 2024).
Results
From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023\textendash 2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 \% in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 \% of cases and in 87.8 \% of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 \pm  0.26) and clear (4.8 \pm  0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).

However, previous studies have mainly focused on how individual factors affect GAI risk perception while the technical functions and features that are the root causes of user concerns regarding GAI remain unclear. To address this gap, the current study, grounded in affordance theory, explored how perceived affordances of GAI influenced user risk perceptions across six dimensions: information, security, technical, social, ethical, and legal. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted on a survey of 1,031 GAI users to examine the impact of interactivity, agency, and security affordances on these risk dimensions. The results indicate that higher perceptions of affordances such as bandwidth, synchrony, and transparency are significantly associated with lower risk perceptions across all dimensions. Notably, women reported higher perceived risks than men in most categories, whereas age and GAI usage experience did not significantly affect these perceptions. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing user control, transparency, and privacy protections in GAI system design to effectively mitigate perceived risks. This study contributes to the literature by providing a multidimensional analysis of risk perception in the context of GAI, offering practical insights for the development of inclusive, transparent, and user-centered artificial intelligence systems.},

Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 \% of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 \% of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.},

Although the supervised models now in use are competent, they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy.

Collaborative problem-solving skills are among the most important skills in the 21st century. However, learners exhibit significant deficiencies in terms of their collaborative problem-solving skills. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have given rise to transformative opportunities to facilitate collaborative problem solving through the introduction of adaptive learning mechanisms in educational settings. This study proposes a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-enhanced multiagent approach that aims to promote collaborative problem solving across different learning domains. The study also examines the effectiveness of this GenAI-enhanced multiagent approach to collaborative problem solving. In total, 234 college students participated in two empirical studies that focused on different tasks but had the same purpose and procedure. Experimental group 1 engaged in collaborative problem-solving with the assistance of a GenAI-enhanced multiagent approach. Experimental group 2 engaged in collaborative problem solving via a chatbot-based approach. The control group engaged in traditional collaborative problem-solving without any support. Data were collected through the pretest, posttest, and collaborative problem-solving process records and interview records. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to analyze the data. The results indicated that compared with chatbot-based and traditional approaches, the GenAI-enhanced multiagent approach had more significant effects on learning achievements, knowledge elaboration, and collaborative problem-solving performance and skills. The implications of these findings are discussed in depth with the goal of advancing the use of GenAI to empower collaborative problem solving.},

However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014\textendash 2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration.

    abstract = {High gas sensitivity materials are crucial for the development of high-performance gas sensors. Traditionally, obtaining such materials has relied on trial and error, a process that is time-consuming, resource-intensive and laborious. In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials.},

    abstract = {In recent years, there have been unparalleled prospects for psychological study due to the swift advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in natural language processing, shown by ChatGPT. This review article looks into the uses and effects of generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like \textquotedblleft Generative AI in psychology\textquotedblright  \textquotedblleft ChatGPT and behavior modeling\textquotedblright  and \textquotedblleft AI in mental health\textquotedblright . First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology.},

    abstract = {The application of generative artificial intelligence technology in the field of visual design is increasingly widespread, particularly showing significant potential in scientific publications. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.},

For each stage, the guide offers examples and best practices while emphasizing that AI-generated content should always serve as a starting point, not a final product, and must be reviewed and verified using credible sources. Potential risks such as hallucinated outputs, embedded bias, and ethical challenges are discussed, particularly in culturally sensitive contexts. Transparency in GenAI chatbot use and researcher accountability are emphasized as essential principles. While GenAI chatbots can expand access to research support and foster innovation in TCIM, they cannot substitute for critical thinking, methodological rigour, or domain-specific expertise.

Therefore, related generative models have been developed to rapidly generate a variety of battery data from a small number of real-world experimental measurements. This study proposes a physics-driven generative model (PGM) to produce realistic battery cycle data by reasonably sampling electrochemical parameters in a stochastic manner. PGM captured the fundamental principles of LIBs as electrochemical parameter distributions and then generated the corresponding virtual LIBs, even under conditions that have not been previously applied. This superior generalizable capability was validated by showing that PGM was very effective in detecting the internal short circuits (ISCs) of LIBs. Synthetic data with different ISC degree effects were generated using PGM based only on ISC-free LIBs. The results showed that a neural network trained on the generated synthetic data achieved a detection accuracy of 97.39 \% for real physical ISCs, which was comparable to the detection results of a neural network trained using approximately 25 times more real data, including experimental results with ISCs. The proposed PGM is expected to contribute significantly to the rapid advancement of AI-based LIB diagnostics by generating physically meaningful data based on internal electrochemical principles.},

Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions.

The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37\% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management.

    abstract = {Background
A substantial cohort of individuals rely on online resources, such as discussion forums, for support on tapering antidepressants. This study aimed to assess the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in responding to clinical queries on tapering antidepressants.
Methods
Ten queries on tapering antidepressants were developed based on previous research, prescribing guidelines, and online peer support forums. Queries covered areas including reasons for discontinuing antidepressants, tapering methods, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse. Each query was submitted to ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) using the GPT-4 model as an independent standalone query using standardised prompts. Responses were evaluated in terms of relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity by two researchers working independently.
Results
GPT-4 responses to all tapering queries were considered relevant and within scope. Most responses (8/10) incorporated safety netting by emphasising the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before making any medication changes. The overall accuracy, completeness, and clarity of responses compared less favourably. The response to a query on hyperbolic tapering had the least favourable assessment. This was due to inaccuracies as the response incorrectly referred to logarithmic reductions and provided inaccurate examples of fixed dosage reductions. Several instances of AI hallucinations were identified, including fabricated references.
Conclusion
Generative AI is having a transformative impact on healthcare, including how healthcare professionals and patients access information about clinical queries, such as antidepressant tapering. The study findings show that GPT-4 was able to provide relevant and safety-conscious responses on antidepressant tapering. However, performance issues such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies in tapering recommendations highlight the important role that healthcare professionals continue to play in providing patients with clinically trained, professional support in safely managing health-related issues. Further research on developing AI evaluation tools is needed to ensure consistency in the approaches used in evaluating the performance of AI in addressing clinical queries.},

    abstract = {Objective
The current study assessed pharmacy students\textquotesingle  perceptions about generative AI before and after participation in a ChatGPT-based drug information activity.
Methods
In 2024, students at three colleges of pharmacy completed a baseline and post-activity survey on their perceptions of ChatGPT including its reliability, usefulness, and impact on academic performance and critical thinking. The survey was modified from the TAME-ChatGPT assessment and used a 5-point Likert scale. After the baseline survey, students answered clinically relevant drug information questions on their own using primary or tertiary resources and compared their answers with ChatGPT responses. Independent t-test samples were used to compare baseline and post-activity surveys.
Results
A total of 227 students completed the pre-survey and 203 students completed the post-survey. Students\textquotesingle  concerns about the reliability of ChatGPT increased after completing the drug information activity (pre-survey: 3.57 \pm  0.96; post-survey: 3.88 \pm  1.11; p = 0.002). Students\textquotesingle  concerns about reliance on ChatGPT and prevention of critical thinking increased (pre-survey: 3.30 \pm  1.34; post-survey: 3.57 \pm  1.21; p = 0.031). The following areas decreased after the activity: enthusiasm about ChatGPT as learning and research tool (pre-survey: 3.60 \pm  1.02; post-survey: 3.32 \pm  1.18; p = 0.008), viewing ChatGPT as an important tool for academic success (pre-survey: 3.40 \pm  1.13; post-survey: 3.12 \pm  1.23; p = 0.015), and concern regarding being accused of plagiarism when using ChatGPT(pre-survey: 4.12 \pm  0.96; post-survey: 3.91 \pm  1.10; p = 0.031). Open-ended responses revealed that students largely perceived ChatGPT as unreliable for drug information, citing concerns about accuracy and outdated content. However, some students noted its potential usefulness for non-clinical tasks such as generating ideas, organizing content, or providing general overviews.
Conclusion
After a hands-on ChatGPT-based drug information activity, pharmacy students reported increased concerns about reliability and over-reliance on artificial intelligence-based technology. The results of this study may encourage pharmacy educators to implement classroom activities for active exploration of the benefits and challenges of generative AI.
Contribution to literature
Limited published data describes pharmacy student perceptions of artificial intelligence platforms as a drug information source. There is even less literature with pre- and post-data after implementing an activity in which students gain hands-on experience critiquing an artificial intelligence platform response. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate student perceptions after using ChatGPT in the classroom and comparing its performance to their own responses based on information from primary and tertiary literature.

The research analyses the use and integration of these programs in creative and productive processes based on 25 in-depth interviews with 13 directors and 12 creatives in both regions. The results show that agencies are using generative AI tools, but for different purposes, and that in some cases, AI is related to the advertising creation process, while in others, it is used for tasks related to the design of strategic communication plans or even the design of prototypes and models.

The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students\textquotesingle  advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications.

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (\beta -VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents novel approaches to enhance motivation, curriculum structure and development, and learning and retrieval processes for both learners and instructors. Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner’s voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI’s in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.},

    abstract = {The rise of image-generative AI has made it a crucial tool for image creators, gaining popularity in fields such as cartography, design, and photography. As users increasingly rely on AI for image creation, understanding the factors that drive user value becomes essential. Drawing on systems theory, this study proposes a conceptual framework to examine the relationships among integration effort, compatibility, synergy, and value creation. Data from 531 AI image creators supported our hypotheses, revealing that: (1) integration effort significantly enhances both compatibility and synergy; (2) compatibility positively influences synergy; (3) synergy directly and positively impacts user value creation; and (4) synergy serves as a critical mediator in the relationships between the two enablers\textemdash compatibility and integration effort\textemdash and user value creation, with compatibility also partially mediating the link between integration effort and synergy. These results extend systems theory by integrating it more deeply with the resource-based view and highlighting synergy as a pivotal factor that not only directly drives user value creation but also mediates the effects of compatibility and integration effort. Furthermore, the study empirically confirms that user value can be conceptualized through three key constructs: efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.},

This symposium paper seeks to summarize current recommendations on the use of GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, and to provide speculations about the future challenges and opportunities of GenAI use in scientific publishing. Due to the dynamic nature of these tools and the rapid advancement of their sophistication, the most important recommendation is that ongoing engagement and discussion within the scientific community about these issues is critical. When using GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, humans are ultimately accountable and responsible for products produced. Given that accountability, an expert panel convened by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently proposed principles of GenAI use in science communication, including (1) transparent disclosure and attribution; (2) verification of AI-generated content and analyses; (3) documentation of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated data; (4) a focus on ethics and equity; and (5) continuous monitoring, oversight, and public engagement. In addition to the importance of human accountability, many publishers have established consistent policies suggesting that GenAI tools should not be used for peer reviewing, figure generation or manipulation, or assigned authorship on scientific articles. Along with the potential ethical challenges associated with GenAI use in scientific publishing, there are numerous potential benefits. Herein we summarize example conversations demonstrating the capacity of GenAI tools to support the article preparation process, and an example standard operating procedure for human-AI interaction in article preparation. Finally, diverse broader questions about the impact of GenAI tools on communication, knowledge, and advancement of science are raised for rumination.},

@article{LUO2025,
    abstract = {Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical research, offering innovative solutions for data collection, patient engagement, and information dissemination. Powerful generative AI (GenAI) tools and other similar chatbots have emerged, facilitating user interactions with virtual conversational agents. However, the increasing use of GenAI tools in medical research presents challenges, including ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and the potential for generating false content. These issues necessitate standardization of reporting to ensure transparency and scientific rigor.
Objective
The development of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools in Medical Research (GAMER) reporting guidelines aims to establish comprehensive, standardized guidelines for reporting the use of GenAI tools in medical research.
Methods
The GAMER guidelines are being developed following the methodology recommended by the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network, involving a scoping review and expert Delphi consensus. The scoping review searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (for the first 200 results) using keywords like \textquotedblleft generative AI\textquotedblright  and \textquotedblleft medical research\textquotedblright  to identify reporting elements in GenAI-related studies. The Delphi process involves 30-50 experts with \geq 3 years of experience in AI applications or medical research, selected based on publication records and expertise across disciplines (eg, clinicians and data scientists) and regions (eg, Asia and Europe). A 7-point-scale survey will establish consensus on checklist items. The testing phase invites authors to apply the GAMER checklist to GenAI-related manuscripts and provide feedback via a questionnaire, while experts assess reliability (\kappa  statistic) and usability (time taken, 7-point Likert scale). The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Health Data Science at Lanzhou University (HDS-202406-01).
Results
The GAMER project was launched in July 2023 by the Evidence-Based Medicine Center of Lanzhou University and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Guideline Implementation and Knowledge Translation, and it concluded in July 2024. The scoping review was completed in November 2023. The Delphi process was conducted from October 2023 to April 2024. The testing phase began in March 2025 and is ongoing. The expected outcome of the GAMER project is a reporting checklist accompanied by relevant terminology, examples, and explanations to guide stakeholders in better reporting the use of GenAI tools.
Conclusions
GAMER aims to guide researchers, reviewers, and editors in the transparent and scientific application of GenAI tools in medical research. By providing a standardized reporting checklist, GAMER seeks to enhance the clarity, completeness, and integrity of research involving GenAI tools, thereby promoting collaboration, comparability, and cumulative knowledge generation in AI-driven health care technologies.

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI’s potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI’s ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI’s transformative potential.

    abstract = {Control structure design is an important but tedious step in P\&ID development. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P\&ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2\% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9\% to 28.4\%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P\&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.},

In this context, it’s essential for researchers to develop their GenAI literacy for research to engage with GenAI effectively and responsibly. This study contributes to identifying key components of this literacy through examining accepted GenAI uses in research practices. Based on a systematically sampled collection of 170 high-impact journals in applied linguistics, we investigated the scope and nature of GenAI use guidelines provided by 76 journals intended to guide authors. A checklist including four items regarding general statements and 17 items regarding three categories of specific aspects that GenAI guidelines target (authorship, uses, and human responsibility) was identified. Our findings reveal that (1) less than half of the journals provided GenAI use guidelines to guide authors, (2) the number of specific aspects varied across journals, with most falling short of comprehensive coverage, and (3) disagreements were observed about whether AI can be cited and used for manuscript drafting, idea generating, image generating, data generation, data collection, and data analysis and interpretation. Additionally, journals varied in their guidance on how to disclose GenAI uses. We propose recommendations for journals in improving their AI guidelines. Importantly, we introduce and conceptualize the new construct GenAI literacy for research article writing (GenAI-LR) that is important for authors to develop.

    abstract = {Purpose
The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into scientific research and academic writing has generated considerable controversy. Currently, standards for using GAI in academic medicine remain undefined. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the guidance provided for authors regarding the use of GAI in ophthalmology scientific journals.
Design
Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis.
Participants
A total of 140 ophthalmology journals listed in the Scimago Journal and Country Rankings, regardless of language or origin.
Methods
We systematically searched and screened the 140 ophthalmology journals’ websites on October 19 and 20, 2024, and conducted updates on November 19 and 20, 2024.
Main Outcome Measures
The content of GAI guidelines from the websites of the 140 ophthalmology journals.
Results
Of 140 journals reviewed, 96 (69\%) provide explicit guidelines for authors regarding the use of GAI. Among these, nearly all journals agree on 3 key points: (1) 94 journals (98\%) have established specific guidelines prohibiting GAI from being listed as an author; (2) 94 journals (98\%) emphasize that human authors are responsible for the outputs generated by GAI tools; and (3) all 96 journals require authors to disclose any use of GAI. In addition, 20 journals (21\%) specify that their guidelines pertain solely to the writing process with GAI. Furthermore, 92 journals (66\%) have developed guidelines concerning GAI-generated images, with 63 journals (68\%) permitting their use and 29 (32\%) prohibiting them. Among those that prohibit GAI images, 27 journals (93\%) allow their use under specific conditions.
Conclusion
Although there is considerable ethical consensus among ophthalmology journals regarding the use of GAI, notable variations exist in terms of permissible use and disclosure practices. Establishing standardized guidelines is essential to safeguard the originality and integrity of scientific research. Researchers must uphold high standards of academic ethics and integrity when using GAI.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in clinical pharmacy; yet, systematic evaluation of their efficacy, limitations, and risks across diverse practice scenarios remains limited.
Objective
This study aims to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of 8 mainstream generative AI systems across 4 core clinical pharmacy scenarios\textemdash medication consultation, medication education, prescription review, and case analysis with pharmaceutical care\textemdash using a multidimensional framework.
Methods
Forty-eight clinically validated questions were selected via stratified sampling from real-world sources (eg, hospital consultations, clinical case banks, and national pharmacist training databases). Three researchers simultaneously tested 8 different generative AI systems (ERNIE Bot, Doubao, Kimi, Qwen, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) using standardized prompts within a single day (February 20, 2025). A double-blind scoring design was used, with 6 experienced clinical pharmacists (\geq 5 years experience) evaluating the AI responses across 6 dimensions: accuracy, rigor, applicability, logical coherence, conciseness, and universality, scored 0‐10 per predefined criteria (eg, −3 for inaccuracy and −2 for incomplete rigor). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc testing and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for interrater reliability (2-way random model). Qualitative thematic analysis identified recurrent errors and limitations.
Results
DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek) achieved the highest overall performance (mean composite score: medication consultation 9.4, SD 1.0; case analysis 9.3, SD 1.0), significantly outperforming others in complex tasks (P<.05). Critical limitations were observed across models, including high-risk decision errors\textemdash 75\% omitted critical contraindications (eg, ethambutol in optic neuritis) and a lack of localization\textemdash 90\% erroneously recommended macrolides for drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (China’s high-resistance setting), while only DeepSeek-R1 aligned with updated American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for pediatric doxycycline. Complex reasoning deficits: only Claude-3.5-Sonnet detected a gender-diagnosis contradiction (prostatic hyperplasia in female); no model identified diazepam’s 7-day prescription limit. Interrater consistency was lowest for conciseness in case analysis (ICC=0.70), reflecting evaluator disagreement on complex outputs. ERNIE Bot (Baidu) consistently underperformed (case analysis: 6.8, SD 1.5; P<.001 vs DeepSeek-R1).
Conclusions
While generative AI shows promise as a pharmacist assistance tool, significant limitations\textemdash including high-risk errors (eg, contraindication omissions), inadequate localization, and complex reasoning gaps\textemdash preclude autonomous clinical decision-making. Performance stratification highlights DeepSeek-R1’s current advantage, but all systems require optimization in dynamic knowledge updating, complex scenario reasoning, and output interpretability. Future deployment must prioritize human oversight (human-AI co-review), ethical safeguards, and continuous evaluation frameworks.},

This paper seeks to explore the factors underlying the frequency of use of generative AI amongst researchers in their professional environments. As survey data may be influenced by a bias towards scientists interested in AI, potentially skewing the results towards the perspectives of these researchers, this study uses a regression model to isolate the impact of specific factors such as gender, career stage, type of workplace, and perceived barriers to using AI technology on the frequency of use of generative AI. It also controls for other relevant variables such as direct involvement in AI research or development, collaboration with AI companies, geographic location, and scientific discipline. Our results show that researchers who face barriers to AI adoption experience an 11 \% increase in tool use, while those who cite insufficient training resources experience an 8 \% decrease. Female researchers experience a 7 \% decrease in AI tool usage compared to men, while advanced career researchers experience a significant 19 \% decrease. Researchers associated with government advisory groups are 45 \% more likely to use AI tools frequently than those in government roles.

Pesticides play a pivotal role in ensuring food security, and the development of green pesticides is an inevitable trend in global agricultural progress. Although deep learning-based generative models have revolutionized de novo drug design in pharmaceutical research, their application in pesticide research and development remains unexplored.
Objectives
This study aims to pioneer the application of generative artificial intelligence to pesticide design by proposing a reinforcement learning-based framework for obtaining pesticide-like molecules with high binding affinity.
Methods
This framework comprises two key components: PestiGen-G, which systematically explores the pesticide-like chemical space using a character-based generative model coupled with the REINFORCE algorithm; and PestiGen-S, which combines a fragment-based generative model with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to generate molecules that stably bind to the specific target protein.
Results
Experimental results show that the molecules generated by PestiGen have superior pesticide-likeness and binding affinity compared to those generated by existing methods. In addition, we employ an active learning strategy to reduce the false-positive rate of the generated molecules. Finally, through collaboration with domain experts, we successfully designed a novel 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor (YH23768) with favorable enzyme inhibition and herbicidal potency.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study highlights the utility of PestiGen as a valuable tool for pesticide design. The web server based on the model is freely available at https://dpai.ccnu.edu.cn/PestiGen/.},

We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators\textquotesingle  sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.},

As the first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current applications and future perspectives for the application of generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence.},

    abstract = {In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies.},

This study examines the effectiveness of Transformer-type generative AI models in predicting cattle behaviour profiles and imputing missing data from collar accelerometer readings collected during two trials in Queensland, Australia, in 2022 and 2023, alongside climatic data. Each trial involved 60 cattle equipped with collars that classified six core behaviours: grazing, ruminating, walking, resting, drinking, and other over five-second time windows. Hourly behaviour profiles were constructed for each animal and experiment day by aggregating the behaviour predictions over every calendar hour, representing the time spent on each behaviour within each hour. Subsequently, four Transformer-type models (i.e., standard Transformer, Informer, Reformer, and Autoformer) were trained on the hourly behaviour profile data to predict behaviour profiles of the next 24 hours for each animal. Among the considered models, Autoformer showed the highest predictive accuracy when including climate data, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of <5.5 min, while the next best model had an MAE of approximately 6 min. For imputing missing data, the standard Transformer outperformed traditional imputation methods, with an MAE of <30 min over 24 hours, compared to 40 to 70 min for traditional methods (mean, median, and linear interpolation). These results highlight the potential of generative AI, particularly Autoformer and Transformer, to enhance predictive accuracy and data imputation in livestock management, thereby supporting regulatory guidance for data-driven decision-making and improved farming practices.},

Traditional design methods often focus on reconstructing functional motifs, but they face challenges in stabilizing structure and reproducing function. In this study, we aimed to develop a design method for small proteins using ProtGPT2, a model that generates protein sequences based on function and structure. First, amino acid sequence data of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was collected, and ProtGPT2 was fine-tuned (ProtGPT2 for MDH). The chain length and perplexity (ppl) of the generated sequences were evaluated, producing shorter sequences than the natural ones. The validity of the generated sequences was assessed using both population and individual analyses. Population analysis, including multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), revealed that ProtGPT2 for MDH identified functional motifs of MDH and incorporated them into the generated sequences. Additionally, tSNE showed that the generated sequences were highly similar to natural MDH sequences. In individual analysis, 10 randomly selected sequences were evaluated using BLAST, AlphaFold2, and InterPro. BLAST indicated that 9 sequences were novel MDH variants. AlphaFold2 confirmed that their 3D structures were highly similar to known MDH structures. InterPro identified domains and active sites in 2 sequences, suggesting that they were novel, small MDH variants. In conclusion, ProtGPT2 for MDH has the potential to design amino acid sequence candidates for small MDHs. The validity and utility of the model will be established through future experimental efforts.},

Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) within their demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. Generative AI has become a new promising technological innovation in the health care domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black American communities. Therefore, rigorous development of generative AI tools to support the Black American community is needed.

The goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, which, by relying on generative AI, facilitates access to ADRD-related health information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, textual, and visual outputs.
Methods
To test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them to perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their opinions and impressions. The main aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app’s usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption.
Results
Our findings highlight the users’ need for a system that enables interaction with different modalities, the need for a system that can provide personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola.
Conclusions
Our study shows that, when designing for Black American older adults, a multimodal interaction with the generative AI system can allow individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their interaction preferences and external constraints. This flexibility of interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI experience.},

We compared the questions that learners asked GenAI versus a human tutor online during a writing task. Using quantitative ethnographic methods, we found that: (a) participants in the GenAI condition asked significantly more questions compared to those in the Tutor condition; (b) GenAI participants tended to ask one-off questions, while Tutor participants tended to have longer conversational exchanges; (c) GenAI participants tended to question pragmatically, asking direct questions about conceptual and procedural knowledge, while Tutor participants tended to make indirect request for feedback; (d) question asking, as measured by epistemic network analysis, mediated the relationship between experimental condition and performance\textemdash the more pragmatic the questions, and thus the more like questions in the GenAI condition, the better the performance; and (e) questions in the GenAI condition were driven by social coordination and knowledge deficits, while questions in the Tutor condition were driven by social coordination and establishing common ground. These findings suggest learners may be less hesitant to admit knowledge deficits and more willing to repair them when interacting with GenAI compared to human tutors. Thus, GenAI can be a useful educational tool when improved performance is the goal and human tutoring may benefit from creating a space where learners are more comfortable revealing a lack of knowledge.},

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate.},

This study aims to investigate the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of investment recommendations of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots for different investment capitals and countries (UK and Bulgaria).
Design/methodology/approach
A two-stage mixed methods approach was used. Prompts were queried into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard (now Gemini). Finance and investment practitioners and finance and investment lecturers assessed the chatbots’ recommendations through an online questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The Chi-squared test, Wilcoxon-signed ranks test, Mann\textendash Whitney U test and Friedman test were used for data analysis to compare GenAIs’ recommendations for the UK and Bulgaria across different amounts of investment capital and to assess the consistency of the chatbots.
Findings
GenAI chatbots’ responses were found to perform medium-to-high in terms of relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification. For the UK sample, the amount of investment had a marginal effect but prompt timing had an interesting impact. Unlike the British sample, the GenAI application, prompt timing and investment amount did not significantly influence the Bulgarian respondents’ evaluations. While the mean responses of the British sample were slightly higher, these differences were not statistically significant, indicating that ChatGPT, Bing and Bard performed similarly in both the UK and Bulgaria.

The purpose of this study was to explore employees’ perceptions and firsthand experiences of the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) productivity tools, specifically Microsoft 365 Copilot, on individual and collective learning processes within a multinational corporation. In doing so, the study provides insights into how these tools can shape workplace learning dynamics, fostering both individual skill development and collaborative knowledge-sharing practices.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors collected responses from 357 participants through a survey that included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. This study focuses exclusively on the qualitative responses. The reflexive thematic analysis method was used to capture and interpret employees’ perceptions of the role of Microsoft 365 Copilot \textendash  a generative AI-powered assistant integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite of applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) \textendash  in enhancing their work and learning opportunities in the workplace.
Findings
The results highlight four key themes contributing to workplace learning. At the individual level, Task Support illustrates the extent to which generative AI productivity tools transform work practices and facilitate both formal and informal learning pathways, while Meaningful Work underscores the tools’ role in enhancing employees’ foundational knowledge through enriched information. At the organisational level, organisational culture suggests the importance of fostering a supportive environment for AI integration, while organisational socialisation highlights its influence on team cohesion and the informal knowledge-sharing processes essential for effective collaboration within and among team members.
Practical implications
The results of this study offer actionable insights for organisations integrating generative AI productivity tools in the workplace. Understanding employees’ perceptions of the role of AI in workplace learning can inform the design of targeted training programmes that promote individual skill development and foster collaborative knowledge sharing. Furthermore, a supportive organisational culture that positions AI as a complementary resource can improve employee engagement, reduce resistance to new technologies and encourage a growth-oriented mindset, ultimately driving both personal and organisational development.

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is showing great promise as a tool to optimize decision-making across various fields, including medicine. In anesthesiology, accurately calculating maximum safe doses of local anesthetics (LAs) is crucial to prevent complications such as local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Current methods for determining LA dosage are largely based on empirical guidelines and clinician experience, which can result in significant variability and dosing errors. AI models may offer a solution, by processing multiple parameters simultaneously to suggest adequate LA doses.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 generative AI models, ChatGPT (OpenAI), Copilot (Microsoft Corporation), and Gemini (Google LLC), in calculating maximum safe LA doses, with the goal of determining their potential use in clinical practice.
Methods
A comparative analysis was conducted using a 51-item questionnaire designed to assess LA dose calculation across 10 simulated clinical vignettes. The responses generated by ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini were compared with reference doses calculated using a scientifically validated set of rules. Quantitative evaluations involved comparing AI-generated doses to these reference doses, while qualitative assessments were conducted by independent reviewers using a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
All 3 AI models (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot) completed the questionnaire and generated responses aligned with LA dose calculation principles, but their performance in providing safe doses varied significantly. Gemini frequently avoided proposing any specific dose, instead recommending consultation with a specialist. When it did provide dose ranges, they often exceeded safe limits by 140\% (SD 103\%) in cases involving mixtures. ChatGPT provided unsafe doses in 90\% (9/10) of cases, exceeding safe limits by 198\% (SD 196\%). Copilot’s recommendations were unsafe in 67\% (6/9) of cases, exceeding limits by 217\% (SD 239\%). Qualitative assessments rated Gemini as \textquotedblleft fair\textquotedblright  and both ChatGPT and Copilot as \textquotedblleft poor.\textquotedblright 
Conclusions
Generative AI models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot currently lack the accuracy and reliability needed for safe LA dose calculation. Their poor performance suggests that they should not be used as decision-making tools for this purpose. Until more reliable AI-driven solutions are developed and validated, clinicians should rely on their expertise, experience, and a careful assessment of individual patient factors to guide LA dosing and ensure patient safety.},

Existing studies often focus on specific domains without addressing broader trust-building mechanisms or the cognitive and motivational factors needed for sustained engagement. This study investigates how trust shapes the adoption of GAI-driven sustainability recommendations by integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) into a single framework. Using data from sustainability-oriented users, we examine how central route constructs-perceived information quality and utility-peripheral route constructs-anthropomorphism and interaction quality-enhance trust, while perceived information complexity and perceived risk moderate these relationships. Our findings indicate that high-quality, useful information enhances trust through cognitive engagement, whereas anthropomorphic design and interaction quality reinforce trust via the heuristic route. However, excessive complexity and privacy concerns undermine trust, highlighting the need for clearer communication and data transparency. This study broadens theoretical understanding by extending ELM and EVT to the context of GAI-driven sustainability efforts, providing an integrated framework that encompasses cognitive and motivational trust drivers. These insights fill gaps in technology adoption research and offer practical guidance for developing GAI platforms that effectively support pro-environmental behavior change.},

These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows\textemdash namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity\textemdash critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks.

Over 90\% of pregnant women and 76\% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.
Methods
Twenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.
Results
Bard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT’s college level by all scoring metrics (P <0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P <0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85\% \pm  10) and ChatGPT (87\% \pm  14) (P=0.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P=0.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22\% vs. 9\%) than ChatGPT (P=0.007)
Conclusion
Answers to questions about \textquotedblleft labor epidurals\textquotedblright  should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4th to 6th grade level suggested for patient materials. Consumers, health care providers, hospitals and governmental agencies should be aware of the quality of information generated by chatbots. Chatbots should meet the standards for readability and understandability of health-related questions, to aid public understanding and enhance shared decision-making.},

This study explores how generative artificial intelligence capabilities (GAIC) could affect digital supply chain performance (DSCP) through ambidexterity innovation (AMI), which includes both elements, exploratory and exploitative innovations in the manufacturing firms (MFs) in Jordan as a developing and emerging economy. This study adopted a quantitative methodology for the data collection process applying a cross-sectional approach through testing deductive-hypotheses techniques. 263 valid surveys were used for analysis using hybrid analysis measurements (i.e., PLS-SEM, and CB-SEM). Further, it was applied data reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity tests. Additionally, examined the mediating effect of exploratory innovation (EXPI), and exploitative innovation (EXTI) on DSCP. The study findings assured that the proposed direct and indirect causal associations illustrated in the study model were accepted due to that all associations between the dimensions s were statistically significant. The findings of the GAIC supported a positive relationship between GAIC and the DSCP, GAIC on EXPI and EXTI, and EXPI and EXTI on DSCP respectively. Furthermore, the mediating effect of EXPI and EXTI is statistically significant, which was confirmed. This study developed a conceptual model to merge GAIC, AMI, and DSCP. This study provides new outcomes that bridge the existing research gap in the literature by testing the mediation model with a focus on the MF benefits of GAIC to improve levels of EXPI, EXTI, and DSCP in Jordan as a developing and emerging economy. Furthermore, this study is considered unique, as it was the first study in Jordan, and through applying hybrid analysis measurements using both PLS-SEM and CB-SEM methods.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is expected to enhance the productivity of the public social and health care sector while maintaining, at minimum, current standards of quality and user experience. However, empirical evidence on GAI impacts in practical, real-life settings remains limited.
Objective
This study investigates productivity, machine translation quality, and user experience impacts of the GPT-4 language model in an in-house language translation services team of a large well-being services county in Finland.
Methods
A mixed methods study was conducted with 4 in-house translators between March and June 2024. Quantitative data of 908 translation segments were collected in real-life conditions using the computer-assisted language translation software Trados (RWS) to assess productivity differences between machine and human translation. Quality was measured using 4 automatic metrics (human-targeted translation edit rate, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering, and Character n-gram F-score) applied to 1373 GAI-human segment pairs. User experience was investigated through 5 semistructured interviews, including the team supervisor.
Results
The findings indicate that, on average, postediting machine translation is 14\% faster than translating texts from scratch (2.75 vs 2.40 characters per second, P=.03), and up to 37\% faster when the number of segments is equalized across translators. However, productivity varied notably between individuals, with improvements ranging from −2\% to 102\%. Regarding translation quality, 11\% (141/1261) of Finnish-Swedish and 16\% (18/112) of Finnish-English GAI outputs were accepted without edits. Average human-targeted translation edit rate scores were 55 (Swedish) and 46 (English), indicating that approximately half of the words required editing. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy scores averaged 43 for Swedish and 38 for English, suggesting good translation quality. Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering and Character n-gram F-scores reached 63 and 68 for Swedish and 59 and 57 for English, respectively. All metrics have been converted to an equivalent scale from 0 to 100, with 100 reflecting a perfect match. Interviewed translators expressed mixed reviews on productivity gains but generally perceived value in using GAI, especially for repetitive, generic content. Identified challenges included inconsistent or incorrect terminology, lack of document-level context, and limited system customization.
Conclusions
Based on this case study, GPT-4\textendash based GAI shows measurable potential to enhance translation productivity and quality within an in-house translation team in the public social and health care sector. However, its effectiveness appears to be influenced by factors, such as translator postediting skills, workflow design, and organizational readiness. These findings suggest that, in similar contexts, public social and health care organizations could benefit from investing in translator training, optimizing technical integration, redesigning workflows, and implementing effective change management. Future research should examine larger translator teams to assess the generalizability of these results and further explore how translation quality and user experience can be improved through domain-specific customization.},

This study aims to evaluate the performance of ScholarGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) developed for academic purposes, on questions related to dental avulsion. In addition, to analyze and compare it with the results of the previous study evaluating the performance of ChatGPT and Gemini.
Method
A total of 22 technical questions (11 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), 11 true/false (T/F)) were posed to the ScholarGPT. ScholarGPT responses were assessed using a modified Global Quality Scale (GQS). Responses were randomized using an online randomizer (www.randomizer.org) before scoring. A single researcher carried out the assessments at three different times, two weeks apart, and a new randomization was performed before each scoring.
Results
When the answers given by ScholarGPT according to the question groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test, the mean value was found to be 4.64 for MCQ questions and 4.82 for T/F questions. ScholarGPT provided similarly high-quality and consistent answers in both question types (p = 0.590). When the performance of ScholarGPT was compared with Gemini and ChatGPT via the Friedman test, the mean score of ScholarGPT responses was significantly higher than both ChatGPT and Gemini (mean difference with Gemini = 0.75; mean difference with ChatGPT = 1.62, p < 0.001). ScholarGPT produced statistically significantly more consistent and higher-quality responses than ChatGPT and Gemini.
Conclusion
ScholarGPT showed high performance on technical questions related to dental avulsion and produced more consistent and higher-quality answers than ChatGPT and Gemini. According to the findings, LLMs based on academic databases can provide more accurate and reliable information. In the future, through the development of LLMs specific to the branches of dentistry, artificial intelligence systems can produce higher quality and consistent information.},

    abstract = {Background
General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI.
Objective
This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention.
Methods
We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial.
Results
In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98\% accuracy vs 69\%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100\% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62\% and 66\%) about AI at the end of the trial.
Conclusions
This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.

    abstract = {Introduction
In Australia, almost 50 \% of paramedics are female yet they remain under-represented in stereotypical depictions of the profession. The potentially transformative value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be limited by stereotypical errors, misrepresentations and bias. Increasing use of text-to-image generative AI, like DALL-E 3, could reinforce gender and ethnicity biases and, therefore, is important to objectively evaluate.
Method
In March 2024, DALL-E 3 was utilised via GPT-4 to generate a series of individual and group images of Australian paramedics, ambulance officers, police officers and firefighters. In total, 82 images were produced including 60 individual-character images, and 22 multiple-character group images. All 326 depicted characters were independently analysed by three reviewers for apparent gender, age, skin tone and ethnicity.
Results
Among first responders, 90.8 \% (N = 296) were depicted as male, 90.5 \% (N = 295) as Caucasian, 95.7 \% (N = 312) as a light skin tone, and 94.8 \% (N = 309) as under 55 years of age. For paramedics and police the gender distribution was a statistically significant variation from that of actual Australian workforce data (all p < 0.001). Among the images of individual paramedics and ambulance officers (N = 32), DALL-E 3 depicted 100 \% as male, 100 \% as Caucasian and 100 \% with light skin tone.
Conclusion
Gender and ethnicity bias is a significant limitation for text-to-image generative AI using DALL-E 3 among Australian first responders. Generated images have a disproportionately high misrepresentation of males, Caucasians and light skin tones that are not representative of the diversity of paramedics in Australia today.},

    abstract = {Background
The medical interview remains a cornerstone of clinical training. There is growing interest in applying generative artificial intelligence (AI) in medical education, including medical interview training. However, its utility in culturally and linguistically specific contexts, including Japanese, remains underexplored. This study investigated the utility of generative AI for Japanese medical interview training.
Objective
This pilot study aimed to evaluate the utility of generative AI as a tool for medical interview training by comparing its performance with that of traditional face-to-face training methods using a simulated patient.
Methods
We conducted a randomized crossover pilot study involving 20 postgraduate year 1‐2 physicians from a university hospital. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group A began with an AI-based station on a case involving abdominal pain, followed by a traditional station with a standardized patient presenting chest pain. Group B followed the reverse order, starting with the traditional station for abdominal pain and subsequently within the AI-based station for the chest pain scenario. In the AI-based stations, participants interacted with a GPT-configured platform that simulated patient behaviors. GPTs are customizable versions of ChatGPT adapted for specific purposes. The traditional stations involved face-to-face interviews with a simulated patient. Both groups used identical, standardized case scenarios to ensure uniformity. Two independent evaluators, blinded to the study conditions, assessed participants’ performances using 6 defined metrics: patient care and communication, history taking, physical examination, accuracy and clarity of transcription, clinical reasoning, and patient management. A 6-point Likert scale was used for scoring. The discrepancy between the evaluators was resolved through discussion. To ensure cultural and linguistic authenticity, all interviews and evaluations were conducted in Japanese.
Results
AI-based stations scored lower across most categories, particularly in patient care and communication, than traditional stations (4.48 vs 4.95; P=.009). However, AI-based stations demonstrated comparable performance in clinical reasoning, with a nonsignificant difference (4.43 vs 4.85; P=.10).
Conclusions
The comparable performance of generative AI in clinical reasoning highlights its potential as a complementary tool in medical interview training. One of its main advantages lies in enabling self-learning, allowing trainees to independently practice interviews without the need for simulated patients. Nonetheless, the lower scores in patient care and communication underline the importance of maintaining traditional methods that capture the nuances of human interaction. These findings support the adoption of hybrid training models that combine generative AI with conventional approaches to enhance the overall effectiveness of medical interview training in Japan.

@article{REASON2025,
    abstract = {Objectives
This exploratory study aimed to develop a large language model (LLM)-based process to automate components of network meta-analysis (NMA), including model selection, analysis, output evaluation, and results interpretation. Automating these tasks with LLMs can enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability in health economics and outcomes research, while ensuring that analyses adhere to established guidelines required by health technology assessment agencies. Improvements in efficiency and scalability may potentially become relevant as the European Union Health Technology Assessment Regulation comes into force, given anticipated analysis requirements and timelines.
Methods
Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (V2), a process was designed to automate statistical model selection, NMA output evaluation, and results interpretation based on an \textquotedblleft analysis-ready\textquotedblright  data set. Validation was assessed by replicating examples from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technical Support Document (TSD2), replicating results of non-Decision Support Unit-published NMAs, and generating comprehensive outputs (eg, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and convergence).
Results
The automated LLM-based process produced accurate results. Compared with TSD2 examples, differences were minimal, within expectations (given differences in sampling frameworks used), and comparable to those observed between estimates produced by the R vignettes against TSD2. Similar consistency was noted for non-Decision Support Unit-published NMA examples. Additionally, the LLM process generated and interpreted comprehensive NMA outputs.
Conclusions
This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of LLMs to automate key components of NMAs, determining the requisite NMA framework based only on input data. Further exploring these capabilities could clarify their role in streamlining NMA workflows.},

    abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, aging infrastructure demands more advanced inspection methods for structural health monitoring. The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating multi-modal generative AI to enhance human\textendash computer interaction in support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation, image restoration, damage inspection, and human\textendash computer interaction in structural health monitoring.},

    abstract = {The production of modern semiconductor chips is susceptible to variations in air temperature, humidity, and quality, mainly as chip dimensions shrink to smaller than atmospheric dust particles. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are critical in this context, given their role in stabilizing these environmental factors. Gaps in Design and Construction (D\&C) can critically undermine the reliability, performance, quality, and lifespan of HVAC systems during their Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) stages. Current studies illustrate how existing models predicted performance degradation and how the Design, Construction, Operations, and Maintenance (DCOM) gap arises. Despite the substantial implications for Semiconductor Manufacturing Facilities (SMFs), research on HVAC performance degradation remains limited, particularly in capturing and quantifying degradation-related patterns. Compared to other types of buildings, the renovation and transformation of high-end manufacturing facilities are more frequent, and customized design and equipment also lead to model application issues, such as data limitations and incompatibility. This paper aims to propose a novel HVAC system degradation prediction model utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Informer algorithms based on the building characteristics and operation mode of semiconductor facilities to overcome the limitations of data scarcity and long-term prediction, evaluate the comprehensive impact of the gap between D\&C and O\&M stages on HVAC systems. By integrating data augmentation, this model reduces data dependency and can handle incomplete, inconsistent, or discrete data for early prediction in operation, bridging the gap between D\&C and O\&M stages, and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of facility operation and maintenance. In addition to SMFs, the proposed model exhibits considerable application potential in other high-precision building types due to the structural variability.},

To provide an introduction to the uses of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models, in the field of health technology assessment (HTA).
Methods
We reviewed applications of generative AI in 3 areas: systematic literature reviews, real-world evidence, and health economic modeling.
Results
(1) Literature reviews: generative AI has the potential to assist in automating aspects of systematic literature reviews by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, extracting data, and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence: generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security. Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.
Conclusions
Although generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications, it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required. Both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current capabilities and limitations.},

Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming multiple sectors, with significant potential to revolutionise nursing through advancements in education, practice, and research. However, the application of generative AI in nursing remains underexplored, highlighting the need for a comprehensive review of its current impact and future implications.
Aim
To investigate the current state and implications of generative AI in nursing education, practice, and research.
Methods
This scoping review was conducted following the methodological frameworks of Arksey and O’Malley, refined by Levac and colleagues. The databases searched for articles published between January 2020 and April 2024 included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore.
Findings
A total of 4858 articles were identified, with 23 included in this review. Most of the selected studies were published in 2024 (n = 19/23), primarily conducted in the United States (n = 8/23), and largely consisted of quantitative descriptive studies (n = 14/22). ChatGPT was the most frequently used tool, appearing in 95.7\% of the studies (n = 22/23). The articles addressed various nursing domains, including nursing education (n = 12/23), practice (n = 10/23), and research (n = 1/23). Both the benefits and concerns associated with this technology were identified.
Discussion
Generative AI shows great promise for transforming nursing education, practice, and research; however, its integration is still in the early stages.
Conclusion
To fully leverage the benefits of generative AI, nursing professionals must address the challenges associated with AI and lead its ethical adoption. Rigorous research and proactive leadership are crucial to realising the potential of generative AI in nursing.},

    abstract = {The paper explores an innovative approach to evaluate the environmental impact of factory buildings at early design stages. Generative design, a cutting-edge computational technique, is employed to generate multiple factory building design alternatives based on user and case specific boundary conditions, e.g. related to material flow and space restrictions. This paper aims to integrate generative design principles with environmental assessment metrics to improve factory buildings for minimal environmental footprint, e.g. driven through energy demand. Thus, a framework that combines the generative factory design approach with key environmental assessment parameters is introduced. The effectiveness of generative design in enhancing the environmental performance of factory buildings is demonstrated with a case study. A comparative analysis of different designs highlights main influencing factors, as well as trade-offs and synergies between different manufacturing system performances and environmental oriented objectives. With that, the paper underlines the value of generative design as a transformative tool in sustainable factory design and provides actionable insights for architects, engineers, and policymakers aiming to develop greener industrial facilities.},

    abstract = {The rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine has prompted medical professionals to increasingly familiarize themselves with related topics. This also demands grasping the underlying statistical principles that govern their design, validation, and reproducibility. Uniquely, the practice of pathology and medicine produces vast amount of data that can be exploited by AI/ML. The emergence of generative AI, especially in the area of large language models and multimodal frameworks, represents approaches that are starting to transform medicine. Fundamentally, generative and traditional (eg, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML techniques rely on certain common statistical measures to function. However, unique to generative AI are metrics such as, but not limited to, perplexity and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score that provide a means to determine the quality of generated samples that are typically unfamiliar to most medical practitioners. In contrast, nongenerative predictive analytics ML often uses more familiar metrics tailored to specific tasks as seen in the typical classification (ie, confusion metrics measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) or regression studies (ie, root mean square error and R2). To this end, the goal of this review article (as part 4 of our AI review series) is to provide an overview and a comparative measure of statistical measures and methodologies used in both generative AI and traditional (ie, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML fields along with their strengths and known limitations. By understanding their similarities and differences along with their respective applications, we will become better stewards of this transformative space, which ultimately enables us to better address our current and future needs and challenges in a more responsible and scientifically sound manner.},

    abstract = {Background
Trauma exposure is highly prevalent and associated with various health issues. However, health care professionals can exhibit trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing bias, leading to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment of trauma-exposed populations. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models are increasingly used in health care contexts. No research has examined whether GAI demonstrates this bias in decision-making and how rates of this bias may compare to mental health professionals (MHPs).
Objective
This study aimed to assess trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing among frontier GAI models and compare evidence of trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing between frontier GAI models and MHPs.
Methods
MHPs (N=232; mean [SD] age 43.7 [15.95] years) completed an experimental paradigm consisting of 2 vignettes describing adults presenting with obsessive-compulsive symptoms or substance abuse symptoms. One vignette included a trauma exposure history (ie, sexual trauma or physical trauma), and one vignette did not include a trauma exposure history. Participants answered questions about their preferences for diagnosis and treatment options for clients within the vignettes. GAI models (eg, Gemini 1.5 Flash, ChatGPT-4o mini, Claude Sonnet, and Meta Llama 3) completed the same experimental paradigm, with each block being reviewed by each GAI model 20 times. Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square analyses were used to assess diagnostic and treatment decision-making across vignette factors and respondents.
Results
GAI models, similar to MHPs, demonstrated some evidence of trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing bias, particularly in Likert-based ratings of posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis and treatment when sexual trauma was present (P<.001). However, GAI models generally exhibited significantly less bias than MHPs across both Likert and forced-choice clinical decision tasks. Compared to MHPs, GAI models assigned higher ratings for the target diagnosis and treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder vignettes (rb=0.43‐0.63; P<.001) and for the target treatment in substance use disorder vignettes (rb=0.57; P<.001) when trauma was present. In forced-choice tasks, GAI models were significantly more accurate than MHPs in selecting the correct diagnosis and treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder vignettes (\chi {^2}1=48.84‐61.07; P<.001) and for substance use disorder vignettes involving sexual trauma (\chi {^2}1=15.17‐101.61; P<.001).
Conclusions
GAI models demonstrate some evidence of trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing bias, yet the degree of bias varied by task and model. Moreover, GAI models generally demonstrated less bias than MHPs in this experimental paradigm. These findings highlight the importance of understanding GAI biases in mental health care. More research into bias reduction strategies and responsible implementation of GAI models in mental health care is needed.},

    abstract = {Background
Interest has recently increased in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new content. Although the publicly available GenAI tools are not specifically trained in the medical domain, they have demonstrated proficiency in a wide range of medical assessments. The future integration of GenAI in medicine remains unknown. However, the rapid availability of GenAI with a chat interface and the potential risks and benefits are the focus of great interest. As with any significant medical advancement or change, medical schools must adapt their curricula to equip students with the skills necessary to become successful physicians. Furthermore, medical schools must ensure that faculty members have the skills to harness these new opportunities to increase their effectiveness as educators. How medical schools currently fulfill their responsibilities is unclear. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) in the United States currently train a significant proportion of the total number of medical students. These COMs are in academic settings ranging from large public research universities to small private institutions. Therefore, studying COMs will offer a representative sample of the current GenAI integration in medical education.
Objective
This study aims to describe the policies and training regarding the specific aspect of GenAI in US COMs, targeting students, faculty, and administrators.
Methods
Web-based surveys were sent to deans and Student Government Association (SGA) presidents of the main campuses of fully accredited US COMs. The dean survey included questions regarding current and planned policies and training related to GenAI for students, faculty, and administrators. The SGA president survey included only those questions related to current student policies and training.
Results
Responses were received from 81\% (26/32) of COMs surveyed. This included 47\% (15/32) of the deans and 50\% (16/32) of the SGA presidents (with 5 COMs represented by both the deans and the SGA presidents). Most COMs did not have a policy on the student use of GenAI, as reported by the dean (14/15, 93\%) and the SGA president (14/16, 88\%). Of the COMs with no policy, 79\% (11/14) had no formal plans for policy development. Only 1 COM had training for students, which focused entirely on the ethics of using GenAI. Most COMs had no formal plans to provide mandatory (11/14, 79\%) or elective (11/15, 73\%) training. No COM had GenAI policies for faculty or administrators. Eighty percent had no formal plans for policy development. Furthermore, 33.3\% (5/15) of COMs had faculty or administrator GenAI training. Except for examination question development, there was no training to increase faculty or administrator capabilities and efficiency or to decrease their workload.
Conclusions
The survey revealed that most COMs lack GenAI policies and training for students, faculty, and administrators. The few institutions with policies or training were extremely limited in scope. Most institutions without current training or policies had no formal plans for development. The lack of current policies and training initiatives suggests inadequate preparedness for integrating GenAI into the medical school environment, therefore, relegating the responsibility for ethical guidance and training to the individual COM member.},

However, conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) fire simulations are computationally intensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of scenarios that can be practically analyzed. This study addresses these challenges by using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to predict fire scenes in realistic multi-room building layouts, characterized by complex shapes and intricate wall partitions. Three generative AI models for image generation are employed for this purpose: GAN-based pix2pix and pix2pixHD, as well as the diffusion model. These models were trained on an extensive dataset of CFD fire simulations to generate near-ceiling smoke movement and temperature distribution outcomes. When tested on new unseen building layouts, these models demonstrated remarkable accuracy and provided near real-time assessments. The diffusion model achieved the highest accuracy (>94 \%) while requiring the more computational time. The high performance of these models highlights the potential of using generative AI to enhance fire safety engineering by enabling faster and more comprehensive fire risk assessments.},

@article{BLEASE2025,
    abstract = {Background
The potential for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist with clinical tasks is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields.
Objective
This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about GenAI on primary care.
Methods
In January 2025, we conducted a web-based survey of 1005 UK GPs’ experiences and opinions of GenAI in clinical practice. This study involved a qualitative inductive descriptive analysis of a written response (\textquotedblleft comments\textquotedblright ) to an open-ended question in the survey. After analysis, the interpretation of themes was also informed by the technology acceptance model.
Results
Out of 1005 respondents, 611 GPs (61\%) provided written comments in response to the free text question, totaling 7990 words. Comments were classified into 3 major themes and 8 subthemes in relation to GenAI in clinical practice. The major themes were (1) unfamiliarity, (2) ambivalence and anxiety, and (3) role in clinical tasks. \textquotedblleft Unfamiliarity\textquotedblright  encompassed a lack of experience and knowledge, and the need for training on GenAI. \textquotedblleft Ambivalence and anxiety\textquotedblright  included mixed expectations among GPs in relation to these tools, beliefs about diminished human connection, and skepticism about AI accountability. Finally, commenting on the role of GenAI in clinical tasks, GPs believed it would help with documentation. However, respondents questioned AI’s clinical judgment and raised concerns about operational uncertainty concerning these tools. Female GPs were more likely to leave comments than male GPs, with 53\% (324/611) of female GPs providing feedback compared to 41.1\% (162/394) who did not. Chi-square tests confirmed this difference ((\chi {^2}₂= 14.6, P=.001). In addition, doctors who left comments were significantly more likely to have used GenAI in clinical practice compared with those who did not. Among all respondents, 71.7\% (438/611) had not used GenAI. However, noncommenters were even less likely to have used it, with 80.7\% (318/394) reporting no use. A chi-square test confirmed this difference (\chi {^2}₁=10.0, P=.002).
Conclusions
This study provides timely insights into UK GPs’ perspectives on the role, impact, and limitations of GenAI in primary care. However, the study has limitations. The qualitative data analyzed originates from a self-selected subset of respondents who chose to provide free-text comments, and these participants were more likely to have used GenAI tools in clinical practice. However, the substantial number of comments offers valuable insights into the diverse views held by GPs regarding GenAI. Furthermore, the majority of our respondents reported limited experience and training with these tools; however, many GPs perceived potential benefits of GenAI and ambient AI for documentation. Notably, 2 years after the widespread introduction of GenAI, GPs’ persistent lack of understanding and training remains a critical concern. More extensive qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.},
