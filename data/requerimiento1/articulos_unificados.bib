However, in the actual teaching process, there are still problems with the rigid application of artificial intelligence and the lack of data support for learning situation analysis. Therefore, exploring the deep integration model of generative artificial intelligence technology and English writing teaching in middle schools is particularly urgent. By the theory of process-genre approach and blended teaching model, we construct a teaching model of middle school English writing assisted by generative artificial intelligence from three dimensions: teaching resources, teaching process and teaching evaluation. This teaching model realizes the enrichment and personalization of teaching resources, integrates generative artificial intelligence into every step of the teaching process, and comprehensively improves the teaching efficiency and quality of English writing in middle school.},

    abstract = {The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.},

Assessing the stability of power systems integrated with these new energy sources has become an urgent issue. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence-based method for steady-state analysis of power systems was proposed. This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model.

    abstract = {The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K\textendash 12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents.

    abstract = {This thematic review paper delves into the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of interior architecture design. The integration of AI technologies into interior architecture is reshaping the way spaces are conceived, designed, and utilized, offering creativity and efficiency. Current research revealed that there is still a lack of review papers exploring the patterns and trends in the use of AI in interior architecture. Therefore, this thematic review (TR) aims to discuss the current use of AI applied in interior architecture by synthesizing the literature from 2020 to 2024 using ATLAS.ti 23. A keyword search, followed by a filter using inclusion criteria from SCOPUS and Emerald databases, identified 30 peer-reviewed journal articles which then were clustered into several themes \_1) Design aesthetics and methodology, 2) Innovative material design, 3) Eco-Quality design, and 4) Intelligent system design. The results of this study will offer an overview of the need for a new method of designing interior space, and practical strategies for integrating AI in the interior. This review also serves as a valuable resource for interior architects and designers, seeking into the potential of AI in creating intelligent, and user-centered spaces.},

Generative AI provides a new solution for the audit field. To this end, this paper proposes a research plan for audit data analysis and risk identification based on generative AI technology. This study first outlines the application of generative AI in auditing. Then, variational inference is introduced using VAEs to approximate the probability distribution of audit data. In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.},

Adopting the Task-Technology Fit Theory, the research evaluates how AI characteristics (adaptivity, iteration capabilities, learning ability, quality of content) and human traits (self-efficacy, personal innovativeness) influence AI reliance and performance outcomes. A sample survey of 148 middle-level IT employees reveals that AI reliance significantly enhances performance through improved task knowledge validation and higher self-efficacy. While AI’s adaptive and iterative features do not substantially impact reliance, task knowledge validation, and personal innovativeness emerge as crucial factors. The findings highlight the importance of integrating AI effectively into task processes and supporting employee confidence to optimize performance. This research contributes in understanding AI’s role in workplace efficiency and suggests areas for future exploration, including industry-wide studies and qualitative assessments of AI reliance.},

    abstract = {This article addresses the growing importance of understanding how multimodal artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be integrated into educational practices. We first reviewed the theoretical foundations of multimodality in human learning, encompassing its concept and history, dual coding theory and multimedia theory, VARK multimodality, and multimodal assessment (see Section II-A). After that, we revisited the essential components of AGI, particularly focusing on the multimodal nature of AGI that distinguished it from artificial narrow intelligence. Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III\textendash VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

The core principle of false and harmful information monitoring technology is the integration of content feature extraction and monitoring algorithms. Allowing the generation and dissemination of false and harmful information poses potential threats to social stability and the legitimate rights and interests of others. The technical reasons for the generation of false and harmful information are that the quality of training data sets affects the authenticity of output content, the capabilities of deep learning models accelerate the generation of false and harmful information, and the lag in the update of training data sets makes it difficult to detect false news in new contexts.

    abstract = {As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

How do we integrate emerging AI models and tools into our courses in a way that fosters critical engagement? How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human\textendash computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

The questionnaire specifically focuses on the early phase of product development and investigates the current state, challenges and potentials. The results show a high level of interest in the use of AI, but integration into everyday working processes has been low so far. Among the few who incorporate AI into their concept development processes, an indication to shorter concept development times was observed. The automation of routine tasks and a conflicting requirements detection are seen as particularly promising AI applications. Main challenges and barriers lie in the expertise of employees, the costs of implementation and the usability of data. Nevertheless, more than two thirds state that further AI integration is planned.

    abstract = {This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00.

    abstract = {With the continuous advancement of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, traditional artistic design has experienced profound impacts, especially in the field of image generation artistic creation. The application of AI not only provides new creative tools but also broadens the forms and contents of artistic expression. Against this backdrop, this paper focuses on studying how to effectively apply AI technology in the process of intangible cultural heritage artistic creation, overcoming the limitations of humans in the creative process. Through AI technology\textquotesingle s learning of images related to intangible cultural heritage art, this research can generate images with traditional artistic styles, exploring how to use AI to assist artists in creation, including image generation, detail optimization, and style transfer, among others. Finally, this research evaluates the practical application effect of AI technology in intangible cultural heritage artistic creation, analyzes its degree of optimization for the creative process, and hopes to find a balance between AI technology and intangible cultural heritage artistic creation. This not only contributes to the inheritance and innovation of intangible cultural heritage art but also injects new vitality into modern artistic design.},

    abstract = {We are at the dawn of a new area of AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), which holds the potential to automate and generate in ways never before possible and can be applied across countless disciplines from natural language processing (NLP) to image synthesis, interactive simulations, and more. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks and transformers, as well as cutting edge AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, DALL-E, Gemini, and Bing Copilot have made content generation a different game. From realizing intelligent code generation, realistic image synthesis, or personalized search, these tools are transforming industries to software development and digital art, to search engines. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of generative AI technologies and the methodologies behind these technologies, including attention mechanisms, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and transformer-based models such as GPT and BERT. The paper also discusses the implementation of generative AI across Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, highlighting how the use of AI to generate content is revolutionizing the interactive experiences in gaming, education, and training. In the study we also perform performance evaluations of generative AI models on benchmark datasets using BLEU, ROUGE scores etc. We discuss some of the challenges facing generative AI on ethical, computational, and too-often opaque lines and predict that generative AI can transform industries by creating autonomous creativity and personalized learning.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a major boom in recent years and is increasingly penetrating the higher education sector. This study focused on the use of ChatGPT by undergraduate management students. We developed a model called the \textquotedblleft AI Student Satisfaction with Studies model\textquotedblright  (AI 3S-model) to investigate how generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, affects student satisfaction with their management studies. Factors used in the model included AI-related student expectations, AI-related student job expectations, perceived quality of AI among students, and AI-related overall student satisfaction. An online questionnaire was administered to students from economics faculties at various universities in the Czech Republic. We deliberately focused on one specialized economics college and several large economics faculties. The sample comprised 231 respondents. To analyze the data, we applied covariance-based structural equation modelling using maximum likelihood estimation. Our findings indicate that two factors directly and positively affect overall student satisfaction with AI use: their perceived quality of studies and their expectations. Additionally, perceived quality acts as a significant mediator between student expectations and overall satisfaction, as well as between job expectations and overall satisfaction. Students believe that ChatGPT enhances their quality of education, which boosts their overall satisfaction. For management education programs, this means that finding ways to effectively integrate generative AI into students’ learning and establishing reasonable limits is highly beneficial, whereas prohibiting the use of generative AI tools would likely decrease student satisfaction and diminish the perceived quality of their studies.},

This study investigates the factors influencing customer decision-making in relation to participation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based marketing. Drawing on prior research in the field, the study introduces a conceptual model incorporating key variables such as age, Internet usage, information quality, and information credibility. To examine the proposed model, a questionnaire was administered to students from universities in Tehran. The collected data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The findings reveal that customer satisfaction and customer inertia significantly influence customer decisions to engage in smart marketing practices. Among the evaluated variables, information quality was identified as the most impactful factor, while Internet usage had the least influence. These results provide practical insights for marketers and researchers aiming to leverage GAI in customer-oriented strategies.},

This review explores key Generative AI models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), flow-based models and Transformer-based models, with Transformers gaining prominence due to the abundance of text-based biological data and the success of language models like ChatGPT. The paper discusses molecular representations, performance evaluation metrics, and current trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity, novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and cloud-based solutions are proposed. Additionally, a curated list of databases supporting drug discovery research is provided. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for optimized AI models, robust validation methods, interdisciplinary collaboration, and future academic efforts to fully realize the potential of Generative AI in advancing drug discovery.},

However, previous AI literacy frameworks may inadequately reflect specific competencies necessary for proficient GenAI use. To address this gap, this study aimed to conceptualise a GenAI specific literacy framework tailored explicitly for educational settings and systematically examine recent research trends concerning GenAI literacy. Employing a systematic literature review approach, 51 empirical studies published in 2023 and 2024 were selected and analysed based on five identified competencies of GenAI literacy: (1) know and understand GenAI, (2) use and apply GenAI, (3) evaluate and incorporate GenAI, (4) GenAI ethics, and (5) attitudes towards GenAI. The findings indicate that students demonstrated moderate understanding of GenAI concepts but frequently faced challenges in prompt engineering and critical evaluation of AI-generated outputs. Ethical considerations, particularly related to academic integrity, privacy, and data security, were highlighted as significant concerns. Furthermore, positive student attitudes towards GenAI, including curiosity and self-efficacy, emerged as vital components enhancing engagement with GenAI tools. A five-step interaction model was proposed to help in fostering students\textquotesingle  GenAI literacy, emphasising iterative and dynamic engagement with GenAI tools. This study underscores the necessity of explicitly integrating GenAI-specific competencies into educational practices and recommends clear institutional policies, and further empirical research to support the responsible, effective, and reflective use of GenAI in school settings.},

    abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become widely used and applied in various fields. Although several studies have been conducted using generative AI for various qualification exams, to the best of our knowledge, none has focused on performance changes over time.
Materials and methods
In August 2025, ChatGPT 5, Gemini 2.5, Microsoft Copilot, and MediSearch were asked to answer compulsory questions from five years of the Japanese National Dental Examination. In 2024, we also conducted similar tests on other ChatGPT series and Gemini, and the scores were compared.
Results
In 2025, Copilot, Gemini, and MediSearch scored 80 \% or higher, which was the passing standard, for all five years. Although ChatGPT 3.5 did not meet the passing standard for any of the five years, ChatGPT 4o mini and ChatGPT 5 exceeded it for two and three years, respectively. In addition, both Chat GPT\textquotesingle s and Gemini\textquotesingle s scores substantially improved over time and with each update.
Conclusion
This report suggests that generative AI is improving annually and adapting to the National Dental Examination. Although each AI model is suited to different fields, the trends may change over time. It is necessary to continue comparing and analyzing AI models and provide users with the latest information.},

    abstract = {Summary
The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5{'} UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5{'} UTR sequences and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5{'} UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by \sim 200\%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for mRNA 5{'} UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed online.},

This review aimed to explore the current state of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) use in simulation-based healthcare education through a comprehensive examination of GenAI types, applications and reported outcomes.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute’s methodological guidance. Six databases were searched from their inception until February 2025.
Results
We included 28 articles that were published between 2023 and 2025. Articles were mainly in the fields of medicine (n = 14) and nursing (n = 10). OpenAI’s GPT models were most frequently used to portray simulated characters and deliver automated feedback. GenAI-enhanced simulation was generally perceived as accurate, realistic and feasible, with some evidence supporting its use as a supplement to conventional simulation and to enhance learning outcomes. Perspectives, ethical considerations and recommendations for GenAI-enhanced simulation were also highlighted.
Conclusion
GenAI-enhanced simulation is gaining popularity and is likely to evolve alongside human-facilitated simulation. Future developments should focus on building AI expertise among simulation educators and harnessing the synergy between human intelligence and GenAI.

This study aimed to systematically map the development methods, scope, and limitations of existing artificial intelligence (AI) reporting guidelines in medicine and to explore their applicability to generative AI (GAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs).
Study Design and Setting
We reported a scoping review adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Five information sources were searched, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, FAIRsharing, and Google Scholar, from inception to December 31, 2024. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data using a predefined Excel template. Data included guideline characteristics (eg, development methods, target audience, AI domain), adherence to EQUATOR Network recommendations, and consensus methodologies. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer.
Results
Sixty-eight AI reporting guidelines were included; 48.5\% focused on general AI, whereas only 7.4\% addressed GAI/LLMs. Methodological rigor was limited; 39.7\% described development processes, 42.6\% involved multidisciplinary experts, and 33.8\% followed EQUATOR recommendations. Significant overlap existed, particularly in medical imaging (20.6\% of guidelines). GAI-specific guidelines (14.7\%) lacked comprehensive coverage and methodological transparency.
Conclusion
Existing AI reporting guidelines in medicine have suboptimal methodological rigor, redundancy, and insufficient coverage of GAI applications.

Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on \textquotedblleft GAI for Nursing Research\textquotedblright  theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of renewable energy and electric vehicles, batteries, as the core components of electrochemical energy storage systems, have become a global focus in both scientific research and industrial sectors due to their critical impact on system efficiency and safety. However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.},

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a commodity for laypeople and domain experts because of the advent of generative AI (GenAI) models that bridge the usability gap of AI by providing a natural language interface to interact with complex models. GenAI models perform tasks ranging from text generation, such as two-way chat systems, to image and video generation from user-provided textual descriptions. These advancements in AI have impacted Dentistry in multiple aspects. Dental education now benefits from GenAI models by enabling students to address numerous questions through intuitive prompts, receiving instant answers. Dental healthcare practitioners utilize GenAI to gather knowledge quickly and efficiently, improving patient care. In dental research, GenAI supports activities such as academic writing and the discovery of new drugs and therapies. In this narrative review, we summarize the current state of GenAI in dentistry as of 2025, define GenAI models, describe their multiple generation modalities, and discuss their current and potential applications in Dentistry. Finally, we describe the challenges these new technologies impose in our area.},

    abstract = {Aims
This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of undergraduate nursing students.
Background
Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited.
Design
A quasi-experimental study.
Methods
Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66).
Results
After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course.
Conclusion
GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.},

    abstract = {Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven materials discovery offers rapid design of novel material compositions, yet synthesis and characterization lag behind. Characterization, in particular, remains bottlenecked by labor-intensive experiments using expert-operated instruments that typically rely on electromagnetic spectroscopy. We introduce SpectroGen, a generative AI model for transmodality spectral generation, designed to accelerate materials characterization. SpectroGen generates high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra with 99\% correlation to ground truth and a root-mean-square error of 0.01 a.u. Its performance is driven by two key innovations: (1) a novel distribution-based physical prior and (2) a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. The prior simplifies complex structural inputs into interpretable Gaussian or Lorentzian distributions, while the VAE maps them into a physically grounded latent space for accurate spectral transformation. SpectroGen generalizes across spectral domains and promises rapid, accurate spectral predictions, potentially transforming high-throughput discovery in domains such as battery materials, catalysts, superconductors, and pharmaceuticals.},

    abstract = {Background
This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 \%) and used it for general purposes (79.9 \%). However, only 16.2 \% actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 \% were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 \% felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 \% had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 \% viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.},

The graph representation encodes structural elements as edges and their connections as nodes, maintaining critical dimensional constraints and spatial relationships. Using data from bamboo stilt houses built without architects, we make a specialized dataset of geometric skeletons for model training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the distribution of featured elements in building frameworks and in generating structurally sound designs, with GraphSAGE showing better performance compared to alternative methods.

This paper aims to investigate the extent of global consensus on learning design and assessment for GenAI-integrated learning environments.
Design/methodology/approach
This study’s policy analysis approach follows Nguyen et al. (2023) by mapping and analysing current policies and guidelines from intergovernmental organisations. This study conducts a comprehensive review of policies and guidelines relevant to learning design and assessment for GenAI-integrated education, highlighting key competencies, ethical principles and implementation guidelines.
Findings
This paper presents an integrated perspective on the key skills and competencies needed for learning with GenAI, alongside strategies for designing effective GenAI-integrated learning experiences. The study findings highlight the need to rethink conventional assessment goals and methods to capture the full range of learning gains enabled by GenAI.
Originality/value
While recent guidelines have begun to address GenAI’s role in education, there remains ongoing debate over the foundational principles needed to design meaningful learning and assessment in this new context. The proposed integrated framework offers practical guidance for educators and policymakers while also laying the groundwork for future research on the pedagogical and systemic impacts of GenAI integration.},

    abstract = {Background
The potential application of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the capacity of emergency consultants is gaining growing attention. This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version.
Methods
The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted.
Results
In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots \texttimes  15 dialogues \texttimes  4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14\textendash 49 \% for the baseline chatbot and 77\textendash 92 \% for the customised version (p \leq  0.039).
Conclusions
Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable.},

    abstract = {Background
Complex prompting and unreadiness among faculty and students are some of the reported challenges when incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into simulation-based education (SBE) in undergraduate healthcare programmes. However, strategies for incorporating GenAI into SBE are unclear. This scoping review identified current evidence on GenAI technology, its role, study outcomes, and strategies to incorporate GenAI into the SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes.
Methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was adopted. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 21, 2025. Two authors independently screened and extracted data. The PAGER framework collated, critiqued, and reported the results.
Results
Eight studies were included. ChatGPT was the most frequently employed GenAI technology in SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes, to enhance the students’ cognitive and affective learning. Study outcomes focused on usability. Five core strategies were synthesized: (a) establish guidelines on GenAI use; (b) enhance GenAI literacy; (c) enhance competency in GenAI prompting in simulation; (d) ensure pedagogical alignment; and (e) conduct pilot tests.
Conclusions
The findings provide insights into GenAI integration in SBE in undergraduate healthcare programmes. Further studies on the benefits of GenAI when applied to SBE are needed to demonstrate its impact on student learning.},

    abstract = {Background and Aims
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that can lead to a physical, social, and economic burden. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, gained attention for its potential to support medical practice. However, concerns remain about the reliability and consistency of its responses. This study systematically reviews the existing evidence on the role of generative AI in IBD.
Materials and methods
We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020\textendash Sep 2024).
Results
From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023\textendash 2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 \% in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 \% of cases and in 87.8 \% of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 \pm  0.26) and clear (4.8 \pm  0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).
Conclusions
Generative AI shows promise in IBD care, but concerns about accuracy, consistency, and outdated information highlight the need for expert oversight before clinical integration.},

This study examines how demographic characteristics, usage patterns, perceived GAI literacy, and ethical awareness relate to Chinese undergraduates’ attitudes toward GAI in academic contexts. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 895 university students from diverse majors. Participants completed a validated GAI Attitude Scale alongside demographic and experiential measures. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to explore how demographic, experiential, and ethical factors relate to students’ attitudes toward GAI. The findings indicate that female students perceived GAI as more useful than male students, while no significant differences were observed across grade levels. Students from non-humanities majors reported more positive attitudes than those in humanities. Regression results further showed that GAI usage frequency and ethical awareness were the strongest predictors of positive attitudes, while demographic factors such as year of study and major became non-significant once other variables were considered. The final model explained 26 \% of the variance in overall attitudes. These results suggest that students’ acceptance of GAI is shaped less by demographic background than by their engagement with and ethical awareness of the technology. The study highlights the need for universities to integrate both practical training and ethical guidance into GAI-related teaching and policy.},

However, previous studies have mainly focused on how individual factors affect GAI risk perception while the technical functions and features that are the root causes of user concerns regarding GAI remain unclear. To address this gap, the current study, grounded in affordance theory, explored how perceived affordances of GAI influenced user risk perceptions across six dimensions: information, security, technical, social, ethical, and legal. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted on a survey of 1,031 GAI users to examine the impact of interactivity, agency, and security affordances on these risk dimensions. The results indicate that higher perceptions of affordances such as bandwidth, synchrony, and transparency are significantly associated with lower risk perceptions across all dimensions. Notably, women reported higher perceived risks than men in most categories, whereas age and GAI usage experience did not significantly affect these perceptions. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing user control, transparency, and privacy protections in GAI system design to effectively mitigate perceived risks. This study contributes to the literature by providing a multidimensional analysis of risk perception in the context of GAI, offering practical insights for the development of inclusive, transparent, and user-centered artificial intelligence systems.},

@article{LEVIN2025105216,
    abstract = {Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 \% of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 \% of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.},

To estimate the short- and medium-term effects, we use a variety of methods, including a difference-in-discontinuity approach exploiting the exogenous nature of the unanticipated launch of ChatGPT in 2022. There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations \textendash  before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland.},

This study investigated the discrepancies between human and GPT-4 performance in landscape perception and preference, using the Kaplans’ preference matrix as a benchmark. Survey data were collected from 1,333 participants in China, and five typical landscapes i.e. gray, open green, partly open/closed green, closed green, and blue spaces were evaluated. To simulate human-like responses, artificial intelligence (AI) agents using ChatGPT were created with personal attributes mirroring those of the human sample. Results indicated that GPT-4 demonstrated significant divergences from human perception and preference in assessing landscape coherence, complexity, mystery, legibility, and overall preference. While GPT-4 performed comparably well in simpler environments, such as pure single-layer broadleaf forests on flat terrain, it struggled to capture key elements and emotions in more complex or nuanced urban landscapes. Notably, only 2.4 \% of ChatGPT’s responses aligned with human perceptions and preferences.

Communication and empathy are equally vital in maternity nursing. However, nursing students often encounter difficulties in clinical communication due to a lack of communication skills training.
Methods
A Natural Language Processing Virtual Reality Communication Simulation (NLP-VRCS) was developed by integrating ChatGPT-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) with virtual reality to assist communication skills training. The empathy, communication confidence, and skills of nursing students trained using the NLP-VRCS (n = 53) were compared to those who received traditional training (n = 52) at baseline (T0), one week (T1), one month (T2), and two months after the training (T3).
Results
After the results were adjusted using generalized estimating equations, the experimental group scores regarding empathy, communication confidence, and communication skills at T1, T2, and T3 were significantly higher than those of the control group.
Conclusion
NLP-VRCS offers personalized training sessions and advice on communication strategies through real-time interactions with a virtual pregnant woman and AI-powered instant assessment and feedback.},

The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.},

While GAI has gained significant attention across various domains, its utility in breast cancer research has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This study aims to fill that gap by synthesizing existing research into a unified document. A comprehensive search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, resulting in the retrieval of 3827 articles, of which 31 were deemed eligible for analysis. The included studies were categorized based on key criteria, such as application types, geographical distribution, contributing organizations, leading journals, publishers, and temporal trends. Keyword co-occurrence mapping and subject profiling further highlighted the major research themes in this field. The findings reveal that GAI models have been applied to improve breast cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome predictions. Geographical and network analyses showed that most contributions come from a few leading institutions, with limited global collaboration. The review also identifies key challenges in implementing GAI in clinical practice, such as data availability, ethical concerns, and model validation.

    abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the potential of extensive battery cycle data for diagnosing performance degradation in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Therefore, related generative models have been developed to rapidly generate a variety of battery data from a small number of real-world experimental measurements. This study proposes a physics-driven generative model (PGM) to produce realistic battery cycle data by reasonably sampling electrochemical parameters in a stochastic manner. PGM captured the fundamental principles of LIBs as electrochemical parameter distributions and then generated the corresponding virtual LIBs, even under conditions that have not been previously applied. This superior generalizable capability was validated by showing that PGM was very effective in detecting the internal short circuits (ISCs) of LIBs. Synthetic data with different ISC degree effects were generated using PGM based only on ISC-free LIBs. The results showed that a neural network trained on the generated synthetic data achieved a detection accuracy of 97.39 \% for real physical ISCs, which was comparable to the detection results of a neural network trained using approximately 25 times more real data, including experimental results with ISCs. The proposed PGM is expected to contribute significantly to the rapid advancement of AI-based LIB diagnostics by generating physically meaningful data based on internal electrochemical principles.},

    abstract = {Gas turbines (GTs) play a pivotal role in modern energy systems. Accurate thermodynamic modeling is essential for reliable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Existing GT performance modeling methods have relatively poor generalization and adaptability under different operating conditions and different units. This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5\% and 0.54\%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37\% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management. This paper shows an interpretable and reliable approach for the integration of AI with thermodynamics. Following the proposed generative-embedded modeling paradigm, performance prediction of other complex energy systems can also benefit.},

    abstract = {Background
A substantial cohort of individuals rely on online resources, such as discussion forums, for support on tapering antidepressants. This study aimed to assess the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in responding to clinical queries on tapering antidepressants.
Methods
Ten queries on tapering antidepressants were developed based on previous research, prescribing guidelines, and online peer support forums. Queries covered areas including reasons for discontinuing antidepressants, tapering methods, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse. Each query was submitted to ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) using the GPT-4 model as an independent standalone query using standardised prompts. Responses were evaluated in terms of relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity by two researchers working independently.
Results
GPT-4 responses to all tapering queries were considered relevant and within scope. Most responses (8/10) incorporated safety netting by emphasising the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before making any medication changes. The overall accuracy, completeness, and clarity of responses compared less favourably. The response to a query on hyperbolic tapering had the least favourable assessment. This was due to inaccuracies as the response incorrectly referred to logarithmic reductions and provided inaccurate examples of fixed dosage reductions. Several instances of AI hallucinations were identified, including fabricated references.
Conclusion
Generative AI is having a transformative impact on healthcare, including how healthcare professionals and patients access information about clinical queries, such as antidepressant tapering. The study findings show that GPT-4 was able to provide relevant and safety-conscious responses on antidepressant tapering. However, performance issues such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies in tapering recommendations highlight the important role that healthcare professionals continue to play in providing patients with clinically trained, professional support in safely managing health-related issues. Further research on developing AI evaluation tools is needed to ensure consistency in the approaches used in evaluating the performance of AI in addressing clinical queries.},

    abstract = {Objective
The current study assessed pharmacy students\textquotesingle  perceptions about generative AI before and after participation in a ChatGPT-based drug information activity.
Methods
In 2024, students at three colleges of pharmacy completed a baseline and post-activity survey on their perceptions of ChatGPT including its reliability, usefulness, and impact on academic performance and critical thinking. The survey was modified from the TAME-ChatGPT assessment and used a 5-point Likert scale. After the baseline survey, students answered clinically relevant drug information questions on their own using primary or tertiary resources and compared their answers with ChatGPT responses. Independent t-test samples were used to compare baseline and post-activity surveys.
Results
A total of 227 students completed the pre-survey and 203 students completed the post-survey. Students\textquotesingle  concerns about the reliability of ChatGPT increased after completing the drug information activity (pre-survey: 3.57 \pm  0.96; post-survey: 3.88 \pm  1.11; p = 0.002). Students\textquotesingle  concerns about reliance on ChatGPT and prevention of critical thinking increased (pre-survey: 3.30 \pm  1.34; post-survey: 3.57 \pm  1.21; p = 0.031). The following areas decreased after the activity: enthusiasm about ChatGPT as learning and research tool (pre-survey: 3.60 \pm  1.02; post-survey: 3.32 \pm  1.18; p = 0.008), viewing ChatGPT as an important tool for academic success (pre-survey: 3.40 \pm  1.13; post-survey: 3.12 \pm  1.23; p = 0.015), and concern regarding being accused of plagiarism when using ChatGPT(pre-survey: 4.12 \pm  0.96; post-survey: 3.91 \pm  1.10; p = 0.031). Open-ended responses revealed that students largely perceived ChatGPT as unreliable for drug information, citing concerns about accuracy and outdated content. However, some students noted its potential usefulness for non-clinical tasks such as generating ideas, organizing content, or providing general overviews.
Conclusion
After a hands-on ChatGPT-based drug information activity, pharmacy students reported increased concerns about reliability and over-reliance on artificial intelligence-based technology. The results of this study may encourage pharmacy educators to implement classroom activities for active exploration of the benefits and challenges of generative AI.
Contribution to literature
Limited published data describes pharmacy student perceptions of artificial intelligence platforms as a drug information source. There is even less literature with pre- and post-data after implementing an activity in which students gain hands-on experience critiquing an artificial intelligence platform response. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate student perceptions after using ChatGPT in the classroom and comparing its performance to their own responses based on information from primary and tertiary literature. The results demonstrate that despite enthusiasm before using ChatGPT, concerns for reliability and hindering thinking increased after a observing the limitations of its performance in answering drug information questions.},

The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students\textquotesingle  advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today.

However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system.

    abstract = {This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (\beta -VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.},

    abstract = {This study examines the factors that influence the use, adoption, and recommendation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools among French management science students. Our study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT 3) model by including trust, learning value, and empowerment in learning. This extension fills gaps in our understanding of the psychosocial factors influencing the adoption of GenAI tools in higher education. We used a questionnaire and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data collected from 257 French management science students across different institutions. The results show that the most significant factors are performance expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, and trust. These factors explain 49.3\% of the intention to use GenAI tools, 58.7\% of the intention to adopt them, and 39.6\% of the intention to recommend them. However, other factors had no significant effect on behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature on technology acceptance by extending the UTAUT 3 model to an educational context. Additionally, it provides practical recommendations for educators, policymakers, and technology providers to promote the integration of GenAI tools in management science education and prepare students for future professional environments centred on GenAI tools.},

    abstract = {The application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in second language education (L2) has recently drawn significant scholarly attention. Nonetheless, in the context of English as a foreign language (EFL), the fundamental dimensions of GenAI literacy and its psychometric properties remain poorly defined. Without clarifying the factor structures and dimensionality of GenAI literacy, EFL teachers face challenges in effectively leveraging GenAI in their teaching. To address this gap, our study aimed to develop and validate a GenAI literacy scale for the Chinese EFL context, involving 603 EFL teachers. Specifically, a tentative scale comprising 38 five-point Likert items was administered to participants. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the final scale was refined, evincing 32 items categorized into five dimensions: \textquotedblleft GenAI Knowledge\textquotedblright , \textquotedblleft GenAI Use\textquotedblright , \textquotedblleft GenAI Evaluation\textquotedblright , \textquotedblleft GenAI Design\textquotedblright , and \textquotedblleft GenAI Ethics\textquotedblright .

High quality simulation requires a skilled educator well-versed in the simulation standards of best practice including facilitation methods and debriefing. While current approaches such as coaching and mentoring have demonstrated effectiveness, they can be time and resource intensive, potentially limiting their scalability and consistent application. Strategies are needed that improve capacity to support ongoing skill advancement. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may offer a promising avenue to support the ongoing development of facilitator debriefing skills. Our investigative team developed a homegrown GAI chatbot designed to enhance the quality of feedback facilitators receive on their debriefing practices.
Methods
This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and usability of the chatbot among simulation facilitators (n = 6) using a post-test survey design.
Results
Developing a chatbot to analyze facilitator debriefing skills and provide evidence-informed, personalized feedback was feasible. Facilitators reported that the chatbot was both useful and easy to use.
Conclusion
Our chatbot may be an impactful evidence-informed GAI educational tool tailored to the specific needs of healthcare simulation facilitation. Leveraging GAI tools may enhance consistent ongoing facilitator debriefing development using a data driven approach.},

@article{GOH2025100845,
    abstract = {As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1,333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within Goodman’s behavioral dependency framework and self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.},
